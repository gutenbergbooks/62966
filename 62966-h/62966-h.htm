On Behalf of Literature
</h2>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">DeWitt C. Wing</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> is well-nigh incredible that Edwin
Björkman, of his own free will, should
have written the &ldquo;open letter to President
Wilson on behalf of American literature&rdquo;
which appeared in the April
<em>Century</em>. Whenever a man of promise
and power shows the white feather those
who admire him suffer a keen, personal
pain. And yet Mr. Björkman is by no
means the last man whom I should expect
to make a plea for an official recognition,
through honors, prizes, and subsidies,
of an American literature. A
conventional literary man could have
done it, but a great man never.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Björkman, after remarking the
President&rsquo;s ability to appreciate the importance
of what he purposes to lay
before him, asks, &ldquo;Will this nation, as a
nation, never do anything for the encouragement
or reward of its poets and
men of letters?&rdquo; He thinks it ought to
do something because &ldquo;the soul of a
nation is in its literature,&rdquo; and because
&ldquo;we shall never raise our poetry to the
level of our other achievements until we,
as a nation, try to find some method of
providing money for the poet&rsquo;s purse
and laurels for his brow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No specific proposal is made to the
President. Mr. Björkman outlines the
general question, instances England,
France, Sweden, and Norway as bestowing
honors and rewards upon their
writers, and says that he has &ldquo;learned
by bitter experience what it means to
strive for sincere artistic expression in a
field where brass is commonly valued
above gold,&rdquo; and &ldquo;should like to see the
road made a little less hard, and the goal
a little more attractive, lest too many
of those that come after lose their courage
and let themselves be tempted by the
incessant clangor of metal in the marketplace.&rdquo;
Wherefore &ldquo;on behalf of men
and women who are striving against tremendous
odds to give this nation a
poetry equaling in worth and glory that
of any other nation in the world&rdquo; he
appeals to the Chief Executive to take
the lead.
</p>

<p>
A literature worthy of national fostering
does not require it.
</p>

<p>
When President Wilson read Mr.
Björkman&rsquo;s letter&mdash;we may assume that
he has somehow found time to do so&mdash;my
little wager is that he smiled sadly,
and perhaps recalled a sentence that he
wrote nearly twenty years ago, when the
spirit of youth gave a sort of instinctive
inerrancy to his judgments. In an essay
on <em>An Author&rsquo;s Company</em> he said:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Literatures are renewed, as they are originated,
by uncontrived impulses of nature, as
if the sap moved unbidden in the mind.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
In the same essay occurs this wide-worldly
phrase:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
There is a greater thing than the spirit of the
age, and that is the spirit of the ages.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-2" class="pagenum" title="2"></a>
A man capable of the deep, wide
thought which these excerpts contain is
not the man seriously to consider Mr.
Björkman&rsquo;s appeal. Literature is not a
response to a monetary or other invitation;
it is as inevitable as the sunrise,
and opportunity neither originates nor
develops it. The conditions that govern
the rise of sap and its transformations
into beauty cannot be set up by legislation
nor made easier by Nobel prizes.
An artist of original power, born pregnant
with a poem, a picture, or a symphony,
will inevitably give it birth. His
necessity is not to receive but to give.
He is independent of the caprice of
chance. He has no thought of a chance
&ldquo;for sincere artistic expression.&rdquo; He is
not interested in the control of circumstance;
he is the instrument of something
that controls him. Opportunity
never knocks at his door; his door cannot
be opened from without; it is pushed
open by an indwelling, outgrowing
guest. The process is as uncontrived as
the unfolding of an acorn into an oak.
</p>

<p>
I fear that Mr. Björkman&rsquo;s definition
of art, if he have one, needs expansion.
The so-called art which he wishes to have
encouraged as something geographically
local is an imitation which probably
would suffice in a petty world of orthodox
socialism, where writing was a kind
of sociological business. Since unmistakable
art is born, not manufactured
or induced, it were folly to try to nurture
it. Unborn art is nurtured by an
inner sap; it cannot be fed on sedative
pap. It always has been and always will
be born of suffering, in unexpected, unprepared
places, like all its wild and wonderful
kin. Eugenics cannot be applied
to its unfathomable heredity.
</p>

<p>
The soul of a nation is not in its literature
but in its contemporary life.
Literatures haven&rsquo;t souls, even if, haply,
they have considerable vitality or permanence.
Literatures are intricate autobiographies,
vague symbols of personal
feeling, lifted by a modicum of consciousness
into mystic articulation. The
great literatures that are on the way will
be more and more psychological. What
people call love in the world of realism
will play a sublimer part in the world of
consciousness. Prose and poetry in
which our conscious life is more intimately
portrayed will challenge and in a
million years increase consciousness, so
that through emphasis and use this later
acquisition of the race will transmute information
into perfect organic knowledge.
A larger consciousness will break
up the chaos of unnumbered antagonisms
in human relationships. The literature
of description and the blind play
of instinct has served its purpose and
had its day. The literature of the future
must deal with a vaster world than that
in which animals prey upon one another.
Such a literature will not bear the name
of a man, a state, a nation, or an age.
</p>

<p>
We are opposed to the whole idea of
nationalism; we even object to worldliness
in literature; we want something
still bigger: a literature with a sense of
the planets in it. In this new day it is
too late to fuss about nations, geographical
literatures, and races. We are
called toward the universe and mankind.
In this land of blended nationalities our
hope is to evolve a literature vitalized by
the blood of multitudinous races and
linked in pedigree with the infinite ages
of the past. Walt Whitman&rsquo;s poetry
was cosmic; the new poetry will extend
to the planets. The summit of Parnassus
now rests in the gloom of the valley, and
the poet of the future will look down
from the higher eminence to which
science has called him. Man today soars
in flying machines in the old realm of
<a id="page-3" class="pagenum" title="3"></a>
his young imagination. Poets must outreach
mere science.
</p>

<p>
What little patriots call a nation is a
huge dogma that must be overcome. In
poetry there must be an increasingly
larger sense of the universe instead of
nations as man&rsquo;s habitation. National
literatures are exclusive of and alien to
one another; they should be interrelated
and fundamentally combinable. There
can be no local literature if the thought
of the world is embodied in it, and any
other quality of literature must lack integrity.
Wild dreamers insist upon a
literature that shall be superior to political
boundaries. The idea of nationalism
involves the setting up of barriers
and the fossilizing of life. It is a small
idea that belongs to the dark ages. If
we are ever to expand in feeling,
thought, and achievement we must rise
above nations into the starry spaces.
We shall at least be citizens of the world,
and, if citizens of the world, then truth-seekers
beyond the reach of land and
sea.
</p>

<p>
The little question put to President
Wilson by Mr. Björkman cannot escape
a negative answer, unless through petty
exclusions and barbaric insularities we
continue trying to organize, cement, and
perpetuate a nation&mdash;that smug dream
of our forefathers who reeked with
selfishness and reveled in a freedom that
at the core was slavery. Statehood must
give way to a universal brotherhood.
And if this were achieved it would still
be idle twaddle to talk about &ldquo;providing
money for the poet&rsquo;s purse and laurels
for his brow&rdquo;; for a poet&mdash;I am not
thinking of facile versifiers, who are
capable of intoxicating emotional persons
with philological colors and sensuous
music&mdash;is rewarded not by money
but by understanding, and he fashions
his own laurel, even as the sea pink
crowns itself with its ample glory. The
kind of poet whose measure is taken by
Mr. Björkman&rsquo;s pale solicitude is
already generously provided for by an
unpoetic public, and there awaits his
moist brow a laurel of uncritical, national
homage.
</p>

<p>
Whitman, chanter of the earth&rsquo;s major
note, and Blake, exquisite singer
of its subtlest minors, are clearly recognizable
mutations. Apart from the work
of four or five men English verse falls
into infinite grades of imitative excellence
and mediocrity. The best of it is
highly finished manufactured or in part
reproduced art, obedient to a commercial
age, in which little men with renowned
names gossip about nations, and worship
the god of utility.
</p>

<p>
Poetry of the highest quality&mdash;great
enough to burst a language&mdash;is the outflow
of the unconfinable passion of exceedingly
rare individualities that can be
neither encouraged nor discouraged by
any external condition. They are vagrant
leaps of life, wild with the creative
power of projecting variety. They come
off the common stock as new forms having
many characteristics common to their
ancestors but expressing their unlikeness
in mental or physiological development.
Real poets are genuine &ldquo;sports&rdquo; or
mutations; near-poets are made by cultivation.
As a nation grows old and the
impact of its culture upon all classes of
people increases, the greater its production
of so-called classical art; but this
has nothing to do with what I mean by
poetry.
</p>

<p>
What is popularly termed poetry may
represent sincere work; it may answer
to all the technical requirements of versification;
it may possess a sheen of word-music;
it may contain deep, subtle
thought, and yet, despite all these customary
earmarks, it is not real poetry.
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
To be sure, thousands of critics will
acclaim it as authentic, and lecturers will
quote it as beautiful wisdom, but it is
soon lost to eye and memory. And in a
large sense this must be true of the
greatest poetry.
</p>

<p>
One reason why we haven&rsquo;t more and
better contemporary poetry and prose is
that we are under the tyranny of so-called
masters. It is foolishly assumed
that masterpieces are finalities in their
fields. By talking, writing, and teaching
this absurdity we set up popular
prejudices against vital work of our own
time, so that even literary artists, with
an alleged sharp eye for genius, cannot
identify an outstanding genius when it
appears before them. Only that poetry
or prose which is a reminder of or is
almost as good as a celebrity&rsquo;s work is
accepted as art. We thus evolve &ldquo;forms
of appraisal&rdquo; or standards with which
we try to hammer rebels and geniuses
into line. The artist who, confident,
fearless, ample, and resolute, can go
through this acid test without compromise
(fighting, even dying, for his
vision) is the hope of men. He does not
ask for anything; he is a god; the gods
merely command&mdash;not always posthumously&mdash;and
all the world is theirs.
</p>

<p>
It is quite possible to encourage the
profession of writing verse and prose by
making the road easier and the goal
more attractive for the weaklings who
whine for nationalized alms, to enable
them to pursue a craft; but literature in
the big sense is created by all sorts of
men and women who cannot withhold it,
let the world approve, condemn, or
ignore. Hence literature is incapable of
encouragement.
</p>

<p>
In his <em>Gleams</em>, which are the most intimately
personal things that he has published,
Mr. Björkman reiterates the conviction
that artists ought to have a better
chance than they now enjoy to express
themselves. For instance, he says:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
He who is to minister to men&rsquo;s souls should
have time and chance to acquire one for himself.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
And this:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
The children will build up the New Kingdom
as soon as they are given a chance.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
These extracts from his <em>Gleams</em> taken
in connection with our concluding quotation
from his <em>Century</em> article indicate if
they do not prove that Mr. Björkman
regards artists as meticulous persons
who must be coaxed, humored, coddled,
and rewarded in order to incite them to
creative activity. Obviously he means
craftsmen when he uses the word artists.
An artist is impelled to do his work,
which is his pain, joy, and passion. If
life is made easy for him the chances are
that he will lose his independence and
power, and descend to a popular success.
Stevenson could not endure prosperity;
once a man, accustomed to a
hard, uphill road&mdash;he did his noblest
work then&mdash;a sentimental public made
it so easy for him that he eventually
grew fairly Tennysonian in his output
of pretty trifles.
</p>

<p>
A literature worthy of the name might
address itself, in Whitman&rsquo;s words, to
authors who would be themselves in life
and art:
</p>

<div class="excerpt hang">
<p class="noindent">
I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer
rough new prizes;
</p>

<p>
You shall not heap up what is call&rsquo;d riches,
</p>

<p>
You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you
earn or achieve,
</p>

<p>
You but arrive at the city to which you were
destin&rsquo;d&mdash;you hardly settle yourself to
satisfaction, before you are call&rsquo;d by an
irresistible call to depart.

<h2 class="article" id="THE_CHALLENGE_OF_EMMA_GOLDMAN">
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
The Challenge of Emma Goldman
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Margaret C. Anderson</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">E</span><span class="postfirstchar">mma</span> Goldman has been lecturing
in Chicago, and various kinds
of people have been going to hear her.
I have heard her twice&mdash;once before
the audience of well-dressed women who
flock to her drama lectures and don&rsquo;t
know quite what to think of her, and
once at the International Labor Hall
before a crowd of anarchists and syndicalists
and socialists, most of whom
were collarless but who knew very emphatically
what they thought of her and
of her ideas. I came away with a series
of impressions, every one of which resolved
somehow into a single conviction:
that here was a great woman.
</p>

<p>
The drama audience might have been
dolls, for all they appeared to understand
what was going on. One of them
went up to Miss Goldman afterward and
tried, almost petulantly, to explain why
she believed in property and wealth. She
was utterly serious. No one could have
convinced her that there was any humor
in the situation; that she might as well
try to work up a fervor of war enthusiasm
in Carnegie as to expect Emma
Goldman to sympathize in the sanctity
of property. The second audience, after
listening to a talk on anti-Christianity,
got to its feet and asked intelligent questions.
Men with the faces of fanatics
and martyrs waved their arms in their
excitement pro and con; some one tried
to prove that Nietzsche had an unscientific
mind; a suave lawyer stated that
Miss Goldman was profoundly intellectual,
but that her talk was destructive&mdash;to
which she replied that it would require
another lawyer to unravel his inconsistency;
and then some one established
forcibly that the only real problem in
the universe was that of three meals a
day.
</p>

<p>
Most people who read and think have
become enlightened about anarchism.
They know that anarchists are usually
timid, thoughtful, unviolent people; that
dynamite is a part of their intellectual,
not their physical, equipment; and that
the goal for which they are striving&mdash;namely,
individual human freedom&mdash;is
one for which we might all strive with
credit. But for the benefit of those who
regard Emma Goldman as a public menace,
and for those who simply don&rsquo;t
know what to make of her&mdash;like that
fashionable feminine audience&mdash;it may
be interesting to look at her in a new
way.
</p>

<p>
To begin with, why not take her quite
simply? She&rsquo;s a simple person. She&rsquo;s
natural. In any civilization it requires
genius to be really simple and natural.
It&rsquo;s one of the most subtle, baffling, and
agonizing struggles we go through&mdash;this
trying to attain the quality that
ought to be easiest of all attainment because
we were given it to start with.
What a commentary on civilization!&mdash;that
one can regain his original simplicity
only through colossal effort.
Nietzsche calls it the three metamorphoses
of the spirit: &ldquo;how the spirit becometh
a camel, the camel a lion, and
the lion at last a child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Emma Goldman has struggled
through these stages. She has taken her
&ldquo;heavy load-bearing spirit&rdquo; into the
wilderness, like the camel; become lord
of that wilderness, captured freedom for
new creating, like the lion; and then
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
<em>created new values</em>, said her Yea to life,
like the child. Somehow <em>Zarathustra</em>
kept running through my mind as I
listened to her that afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Emma Goldman preaches and practises
the philosophy of freedom; she
pushes through the network of a complicated
society as if it were a cobweb
instead of a steel structure; she brushes
the cobwebs from her eyes and hair and
calls back to the less daring ones that the
air is more pure up there and &ldquo;sunrise
sometimes visible.&rdquo; Someone has put it
this way: &ldquo;Repudiating as she does
practically every tenet of what the modern
state holds good, she stands for some
of the noblest traits in human nature.&rdquo;
And no one who listens to her thoughtfully,
whatever his opinion of her creed,
will deny that she has nobility. Such
qualities as courage&mdash;dauntless to the
point of heartbreak; as sincerity, reverence,
high-mindedness, self-reliance,
helpfulness, generosity, strength, a
capacity for love and work and life&mdash;all
these are noble qualities, and Emma
Goldman has them in the <em>n</em>th power. She
has no pale traits like tact, gentleness,
humility, meekness, compromise. She
has &ldquo;a hard, kind heart&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;a
soft, cruel one.&rdquo; And she&rsquo;s such a splendid
fighter!
</p>

<p>
What is she fighting for? For the
same things, concretely, that Nietzsche
and Max Stirner fought for abstractly.
She has nothing to say that they have
not already said, perhaps; but the fact
that she says it instead of putting it
into books, that she hurls it from the
platform straight into the minds and
hearts of the eager, bewildered, or unfriendly
people who listen to her, gives
her personality and her message a unique
value. She says it with the same unflinching
violence to an audience of capitalists
as to her friends the workers.
And the substance of her gospel&mdash;I
speak merely from the impressions of
those two lectures and the very little
reading I&rsquo;ve done of her published work&mdash;is
something of this sort:
</p>

<p>
Radical changes in society, releasement
from present injustices and miseries,
can come about not through <em>reform</em>
but through <em>change</em>; not through
a patching up of the old order, but
through a tearing down and a rebuilding.
This process involves the repudiation
of such &ldquo;spooks&rdquo; as Christianity,
conventional morality, immortality, and
all other &ldquo;myths&rdquo; that stand as obstacles
to progress, freedom, health,
truth, and beauty. One thus achieves
that position beyond good and evil for
which Nietzsche pleaded. But it is more
fair to use Miss Goldman&rsquo;s own words.
In writing of the failure of Christianity,
for instance, she says:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
I believe that Christianity is most admirably
adapted to the training of slaves, to the perpetuation
of a slave society; in short, to the
very conditions confronting us today. Indeed,
never could society have degenerated to its present
appalling stage if not for the assistance of
Christianity.... No doubt I will be told that,
though religion is a poison and institutionalized
Christianity the greatest enemy of progress and
freedom, there is some good in Christianity
itself. What about the teachings of Christ and
early Christianity, I may be asked; do they
not stand for the spirit of humanity, for right,
and justice?
</p>

<p>
It is precisely this oft-repeated contention
that induced me to choose this subject, to enable
me to demonstrate that the abuses of Christianity,
like the abuses of government, are conditioned
in the thing itself, and are not to be
charged to the representatives of the creed.
Christ and his teachings are the embodiment
of inertia, of the denial of life; hence responsible
for the things done in their name.
</p>

<p>
I am not interested in the theological Christ.
Brilliant minds like Bauer, Strauss, Renan,
Thomas Paine, and others refuted that myth
long ago. I am even ready to admit that the
theological Christ is not half so dangerous as
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
the ethical and social Christ. In proportion as
science takes the place of blind faith, theology
loses its hold. But the ethical and poetical
Christ-myth has so thoroughly saturated our
lives, that even some of the most advanced
minds find it difficult to emancipate themselves
from its yoke. They have rid themselves of the
letter, but have retained the spirit; yet it is the
spirit which is back of all the crimes and horrors
committed by orthodox Christianity. The
Fathers of the Church can well afford to preach
the gospel of Christ. It contains nothing dangerous
to the régime of authority and wealth;
it stands for self-denial and self-abnegation,
for penance and regret, and is absolutely inert
in the face of every indignity, every outrage
imposed upon mankind.... Many otherwise
earnest haters of slavery and injustice confuse,
in a most distressing manner, the teachings of
Christ with the great struggles for social and
economic emancipation. The two are irrevocably
and forever opposed to each other. The
one necessitates courage, daring, defiance, and
strength. The other preaches the gospel of non-resistance,
of slavish acquiescence in the will of
others; it is the complete disregard of character
and self-reliance, and, therefore, destructive of
liberty and well-being....
</p>

<p>
The public career of Christ begins with the
edict, &ldquo;Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is
at hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Why repent, why regret, in the face of
something that was supposed to bring deliverance?
Had not the people suffered and endured
enough; had they not earned their right to deliverance
by their suffering? Take the Sermon
on the Mount, for instance; what is it but a
eulogy on submission to fate, to the inevitability
of things?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Heaven must be an awfully dull place if the
poor in spirit live there. How can anything
creative, anything vital, useful, and beautiful,
come from the poor in spirit? The idea conveyed
in the Sermon on the Mount is the greatest
indictment against the teachings of Christ,
because it sees in the poverty of mind and body
a virtue, and because it seeks to maintain this
virtue by reward and punishment. Every intelligent
being realizes that our worst curse is the
poverty of the spirit; that it is productive of
all evil and misery, of all the injustice and
crimes in the world.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit
the earth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What a preposterous notion! What incentive
to slavery, inactivity, and parasitism. Besides,
it is not true that the meek can inherit
anything.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Blessed are ye when men shall revile you
... for great is your reward in heaven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The reward in heaven is the perpetual bait,
a bait that has caught man in an iron net, a
strait-jacket which does not let him expand
or grow. All pioneers of truth have been, and
still are, reviled. But did they ask humanity to
pay the price? Did they seek to bribe mankind
to accept their ideas?... Redemption through
the Cross is worse than damnation, because of
the terrible burden it imposes upon humanity,
because of the effect it has on the human soul,
fettering and paralyzing it with the weight
of the burden exacted through the death of
Christ....
</p>

<p>
The teachings of Christ and of his followers
have failed because they lacked the vitality to
lift the burdens from the shoulders of the race;
they have failed because the very essence of
that doctrine is contrary to the spirit of life,
opposed to the manifestation of nature, to the
strength and beauty of passion.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
And so on. In her dissolution of
other &ldquo;myths&rdquo;&mdash;such as that of morality,
for instance,&mdash;she has even more
direct things to say. I quote from a
lecture on <em>Victims of Morality</em>:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
It is Morality which condemns woman to the
position of a celibate, a prostitute, or a reckless,
incessant breeder of children.
</p>

<p>
First as to the celibate, the famished and
withered human plant. When still a young,
beautiful flower, she falls in love with a respectable
young man. But Morality decrees
that unless he can marry the girl, she must
never know the raptures of love, the ecstasy of
passion. The respectable young man is willing
to marry, but the Property Morality, the
Family and Social Moralities decree that he
must first make his pile, must save up enough
to establish a home and be able to provide for
a family. The young people must wait, often
many long, weary years.... And the young
flower, with every fiber aglow with the love of
life? She develops headaches, insomnia, hysteria;
grows embittered, quarrelsome, and soon
becomes a faded, withered, joyless being, a nuisance
to herself and every one else.... Hedged
in her narrow confines with family and social
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
tradition, guarded by a thousand eyes, afraid
of her own shadow&mdash;the yearning of her inmost
being for the man or the child, she must turn
to cats, dogs, canary birds, or the Bible class.
</p>

<p>
Now as to the prostitute. In spite of laws,
ordinances, persecution, and prisons; in spite
of segregation, registration, vice crusades, and
other similar devices, the prostitute is the real
specter of our age.... What has made her?
Whence does she come? Morality, the morality
which is merciless in its attitude to women.
Once she dares to be herself, to be true to her
nature, to life, there is no return; the woman
is thrust out from the pale and protection of
society. The prostitute becomes the victim of
Morality, even as the withered old maid is its
victim. But the prostitute is victimized by still
other forces, foremost among them the Property
Morality, which compels woman to sell herself
as a sex commodity or in the sacred fold
of matrimony. The latter is no doubt safer,
more respected, more recognized, but of the two
forms of prostitution the girl of the street is
the least hypocritical, the least debased, since
her trade lacks the pious mask of hypocrisy,
and yet she is hounded, fleeced, outraged, and
shunned by the very powers that have made
her: the financier, the priest, the moralist, the
judge, the jailer, and the detective, not to forget
her sheltered, respectably virtuous sister,
who is the most relentless and brutal in her
persecution of the prostitute.
</p>

<p>
Morality and its victim, the mother&mdash;what
a terrible picture! Is there, indeed, anything
more terrible, more criminal, than our glorified
sacred function of motherhood? The woman,
physically and mentally unfit to be a mother,
yet condemned to breed; the woman, economically
taxed to the very last spark of energy, yet
forced to breed; the woman, tied to a man she
loathes, yet made to breed; the woman, worn
and used-up from the process of procreation,
yet coerced to breed, more, ever more. What a
hideous thing, this much-lauded motherhood!
</p>

<p>
With the economic war raging all around
her, with strife, misery, crime, disease, and
insanity staring her in the face, with numberless
little children ground into gold dust, how
can the self and race-conscious woman become
a mother? Morality cannot answer this question.
It can only dictate, coerce, or condemn&mdash;and
how many women are strong enough to
face this condemnation, to defy the moral dicta?
Few indeed. Hence they fill the factories, the
reformatories, the homes for feeble-minded, the
prisons.... Oh, Motherhood, what crimes are
committed in thy name! What hosts are laid
at your feet. Morality, destroyer of life!
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, the Dawn is emerging from the
chaos and darkness.... Through her re-born
consciousness as a unit, a personality, a race
builder, woman will become a mother only if
she desires the child, and if she can give to the
child, even before its birth, all that her nature
and intellect can yield ... above all, understanding,
reverence, and love, which is the only
fertile soil for new life, a new being.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
I have talked lately with a man who
thinks Emma Goldman ought to have
been hanged long ago. She&rsquo;s directly or
indirectly &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; for so many
crimes. &ldquo;Do you know what she&rsquo;s trying
to do?&rdquo; I asked him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s trying to break up our government,&rdquo;
he responded heatedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you ever read any of her
ideas?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you ever heard her lecture?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>No!</em> I should say not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In a play, that line would get a laugh.
(It did in <em>Man and Superman</em>.) But in
life it fares better. It gets serious consideration;
it even has a certain prestige
as a rather righteous thing to say.
</p>

<p>
Another man threw himself into the
argument. &ldquo;I know very little about
Emma Goldman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it has
always struck me that she&rsquo;s simply trying
to inflame people&mdash;particularly to
do things that she&rsquo;d never think of doing
herself.&rdquo; That charge can be answered
best by a study of her life, which will
show that she has spent her time doing
things that almost no one else would dare
to do.
</p>

<p>
In his <em>Women as World Builders</em>
Floyd Dell said this: &ldquo;Emma Goldman
has become simply an advocate of freedom
of every sort. She does not advocate
violence any more than Ralph
Waldo Emerson advocated violence. It
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
is, in fact, as an essayist and speaker of
the kind, if not the quality, of Emerson,
Thoreau, and George Francis Train,
that she is to be considered.&rdquo; I think,
rather, that she is to be considered fundamentally
as something more definite
than that:&mdash;as a practical Nietzschean.
</p>

<p>
I am incapable of listening, unaroused,
to the person who believes
something intensely, and who does intensely
what she believes. What more
simple&mdash;or more difficult? Most of us
don&rsquo;t know what we believe, or, if we do,
we have the most extraordinary time trying
to live it. Emma Goldman is so
bravely consistent&mdash;which to many
people is a confession of limitations.
But if one is going to criticise her there
are more subtle grounds to do it on.
One of her frequent assertions is that
she has no use for religion. That is like
saying that one has no use for poetry:
religion isn&rsquo;t merely a matter of Christianity
or Catholicism or Buddhism or
any other classifiable quantity. Also, if
it is true that the person to be distrusted
is the one who has found an answer to
the riddle, then Emma Goldman is to be
discounted. Her convictions are presented
with a sense of definite finality.
But there&rsquo;s something splendidly uncautious,
something irresistibly stirring,
about such an attitude. And whatever
one believes, of one thing I&rsquo;m certain:
whoever means to face the world and its
problems intelligently must know something
about Emma Goldman. Whether
her philosophy will change the face of
the earth isn&rsquo;t the supreme issue. As
the enemy of all smug contentment, of
all blind acquiescence in things as they
are, and as the prophet who dares to
preach that our failures are not in
wrong applications of values but in the
values themselves, Emma Goldman is the
most challenging spirit in America.
</p>

No sooner is a thing brought to sight than it

&ldquo;True to Life&rdquo;

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span> recent sincere and beautiful
greeting from Mr. John Galsworthy
to <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> suggests
that the creative artist and the creative
critic in America may wisely heed a saying
of de Maupassant about a writer
&ldquo;sitting down before an object until he
has seen it in the way that he alone can
see it, seen it with the part of him which
makes <a id="corr-1"></a>him This man and not That.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Galsworthy adds: &ldquo;And I did
seem to notice in America that there was
a good deal of space and not much time;
and that without too much danger of becoming
&lsquo;Yogis,&rsquo; people might perhaps
sit down a little longer in front of things
than they seemed to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What native observer of American
writing will not welcome the justice of
this comment? Surely the contemporary
American poems, novels, tales, and critiques
which express an individual and
attentively-considered impression of any
subject from our own life here are few:
and these not, it would appear, greatly
in vogue. Why? Everyone will have
his own answer.
</p>

<p>
In replying to the first part of the
question&mdash;why closely-considered individual
impressions of our life are few&mdash;I
think it should be said that the habit
of respect for close attention of any kind
is not among the American virtues. The
visitor of our political conventions, the
reader of our &ldquo;literary criticism&rdquo; must
have noted a prevailing, shuffling, and
perfunctory mood of casual disregard
for the matter in hand. Many American
people are indeed reared to suppose that
if they appear to bestow an interested attention
on the matter before them, some
misunderstanding will ensue as to their
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
own social importance. Nearly everyone
must have noted with a sinking of the
heart this attitude towards the public
among library attendants, hotel-clerks,
and plumbers. This abstraction is not,
however, confined to the pursuers of any
occupation, but to some degree affects
us all. In the consciousness of our nation
there appears to exist a mysterious
though deep-seated awe for the prestige
of the casual and the off-hand.
</p>

<p>
Especially we think it an unworthiness
in an author that he should, as the phrase
is, &ldquo;take himself seriously.&rdquo; We consider
the attitude we have described as
characterizing library attendants and
hotel-clerks as the only correct one for
writers&mdash;the attitude of a person doing
something as it were unconsciously, a
matter he pooh-poohs and scarcely cares
to expend his energy and time upon in
the grand course of his personal existence.
You may hear plenty of American
authors talk of &ldquo;not taking themselves
seriously&rdquo; who, if they spoke with accuracy,
should say that they regarded
themselves as too important and precious
to exhaust themselves by doing their
work with conscience.
</p>

<p>
This dull self-importance insidiously
saps in our country the respect for thoroughness
and application characteristic
of Germany; insidiously blunts in American
penetrative powers the English faculty
of being &ldquo;keen&rdquo; on a subject, recently
presented to us with such grace
in the young hero&rsquo;s eager pursuits in
Compton Mackenzie&rsquo;s <em>Sinister Street</em>;
and disparages lightly but often completely
the growth of the fresh and varied
spirit of production described in the
passage of de Maupassant to which Mr.
Galsworthy refers. This passage expresses
the clear fire of attention our
American habits lack, with a sympathy
it is a pleasure to quote here in its entirety.
De Maupassant says in the preface
of <em>Pierre et Jean</em>:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
For seven years I wrote verses, I wrote
stories, I wrote novels. I even wrote a detestable
play. Of these nothing survives. The
master (Flaubert) read them all, and on the
following Sunday at luncheon he would give
me his criticism, and inculcate little by little
two or three principles that sum up his long
and patient lesson. &ldquo;If one has any originality,
the first thing requisite is to bring it
out: if one has none, the first thing to be done
is to acquire it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Talent is long patience. Everything which
one desires to express must be considered with
sufficient attention and during a sufficiently
long time to discover in it some aspect which
no one has yet seen or described. In everything
there is still some spot unexplored, because
we are accustomed to look at things only
with the recollection of what others before us
have thought of the subject we are contemplating.
The smallest object contains something
unknown. Let us find it. In order to
describe a fire that flames and a tree on the
plain, we must keep looking at that flame and
that tree until to our eyes they no longer
resemble any other tree, or any other fire.
</p>

<p>
This is the way to become original.
</p>

<p>
Having besides laid down this truth that
there are not in the whole world two grains of
sand, two specks, two hands, or two noses alike,
Flaubert compelled me to describe in a few
phrases a being or an object in such a manner
as to clearly particularize it, and distinguish it
from all the other beings or all the other
objects of the same race, or the same species.
&ldquo;When you pass,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;a grocer
seated at his shop door, a janitor smoking his
pipe, a stand of hackney coaches, show me that
grocer and that janitor, their attitude, their
whole physical appearance, including also by a
skilful description their whole moral nature
so that I cannot confound them with any other
grocer or any other janitor: make me see, in
one word, that a certain cab-horse does not
resemble the fifty others that follow or precede
it.&rdquo;
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
One underlying reason why American
writers so seldom pursue such studies and
methods as these is the prevailing disesteem
for clearly-focussed attention we
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
have described. Another reason is that
the American writer of fiction who loves
the pursuit of precise expression will
indubitably have to face a number of
difficulties which may perhaps not be
readily apparent to the writers of other
countries.
</p>

<p>
Naturally enough, in his more newly-settled,
or rather his settling, nation,
made up of many nationalities, the American
writer who desires to &ldquo;particularize&rdquo;
a subject from his country&rsquo;s contemporary
history, and &ldquo;to distinguish
this from all the other beings and all the
other objects of the same race,&rdquo; will have
many more heretofore unexpressed conditions
and basic circumstances to evoke
in his reader&rsquo;s mind than the German or
French or English writer must summon.
</p>

<p>
For instance, the young French writer
of de Maupassant&rsquo;s narrative who was to
call up out of the deep of European life
the individuality of one single French
grocer, would himself have and would
address an audience who had&mdash;whether
for better or worse (to my way of thinking,
as it chances, for worse)&mdash;a fairly
fixed social conception of the class of this
retail merchant. The American writer
who knows very well that General Grant
once kept an unsuccessful shoe store,
and that some of the most distinguished
paintings the country possesses have been
selected by the admirably-educated taste
and knowledge of one or two public-spirited
retail dry-goods merchants; and
who also has seen gaunt and poverty-stricken
Russian store-keepers standing
among stalls of rotten strawberries in
Jefferson Street market, in Chicago&mdash;that
writer will neither speak from nor
address this definite social conception according
to mere character of occupation
which I have indicated as a part of the
French author&rsquo;s means of exactitude in
expression.
</p>

<p>
Nothing in our own random civilization,
as it seems to me, is quite so fixed as
that French grocer seated in his doorway,
that de Maupassant and Flaubert
mention with such charm. Nothing here
is so neat as that. To convey social
truth, the American writer interested in
giving his own impression of a grocer in
America, whether rich or poor or moderately
prospering, will have to individualize
him and all his surrounding condition
more, and to classify him and all his surrounding
condition less, than de Maupassant
does, to convey the social truth
his own inimitable sketches impart.
</p>

<p>
Again, ours is a very changing population.
Its movement of life through
one of our cities is attended with various
and choppy and many-toned sounds communicating
a varied rhythm of its own.
To return to our figure of the retail
tradesman&mdash;if this tradesman be in Chicago,
for instance, he may neither be
expressed clearly by typical classifications,
nor shown without a genuine error
in historical perspective against a static
street background and trade life. This
background must have change and motion,
unless the writer is to copy into
his own picture some foreign author&rsquo;s
rendition of a totally different place and
state of human existence. The tune of
the story&rsquo;s text, too, should repeat for
the reader&rsquo;s inward ear the special experience
of truth the author has perceived,
the special ragged sound and
rhythm of the motion of life he has
heard telling the tale of that special
place.
</p>

<p>
May one add what is only too obvious,
and said because I think it may serve
to explain in some degree why individual
impressions of American life are
not greatly encouraged in this country?
It will be quite plain that such a limpid,
clear-spaced, reverent style and stilled
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
background as speaks in one of Mr.
Galsworthy&rsquo;s stories the tragedy of a
London shoe-maker&rsquo;s commercial ruin,
would be false to all these values. It
will be quite plain that such a bright,
hard, definite manner as that which states
with perfection the life of the circles
of the petty government-official and his
wife in <em>The Necklace</em> would be powerless
to convey some of the elements we have
selected as characterizing the American
subject we have tried to suggest.
</p>

<p>
But many American reviewers and
professional readers and publishers, who
suppose themselves to be devoted to
&ldquo;realism&rdquo; and to writing of &ldquo;radical&rdquo;
tendency, believe not at all that the realistic
writer should adopt de Maupassant&rsquo;s
method and incarnate for us his
own American vision of the life he sees
here, but simply that he should imitate
the manner of de Maupassant. Many
such American reviewers and professional
readers and publishers believe not
at all that the radical writer should find
and represent for us some unseen branching
root of certain American social phenomena
which he himself has detected,
but simply that he should copy some
excellent drawing of English roots by
Mr. Galsworthy, or of Russian roots by
Gorky.
</p>

<p>
The craze for imitation in American
writing is almost unbelievably pervasive.
The author here, who is devoted to
the attempt to speak his own truth&mdash;and
the more devoted he is the more
reverently, I believe, will he regard all
other authors&rsquo; truth as theirs and derived
exactly from their own point of view&mdash;will
find opposed to him not only the
great body of conventional romanticists
and conservatives who will think he ought
to stereotype and conventionalize his
work into a poor, dulled contemporary
imitation of the delightful narratives
of Sir Walter Scott. He will also find
opposed to him the great body of conventional
&ldquo;realists&rdquo; and &ldquo;radicals&rdquo; who
will think he ought to stereotype and
conventionalize his work into a poor,
blurred imitation of the keen narratives
of Mr. H. G. Wells.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes these counsellors, not content
with commending a copied manner,
seriously urge&mdash;one might think at the
risk of advising plagiarism&mdash;that the
American author simply transplant the
social ideas of some admirable foreign
artist to one of our own local scenes.
Thus, a year or two ago, in one of our
critical journals, I saw the writer of a
novel about Indiana state politicians severely
blamed for not making the same
observations on the subject that Mr.
Wells had made about English national
parliamentary life in <em>The New Machiavelli</em>.
Not long since another American
reviewer of &ldquo;radical&rdquo; tendency harshly
censured the author of a novel about
American under-graduate life in a New
York college, because the daughter of
the college president uttered views of
sex and marriage unlike those expressed
in <em>Ann Veronica</em>.
</p>

<p>
This sort of criticism&mdash;equally unflattering
and obtuse, it appears to me,
in its perception of the special characterizations
of Mr. Wells&rsquo;s thoughtful pages,
and in its counsel to the artist depicting
an alien topic to insert extraneous
and unrelated views in his landscape&mdash;proceeds
from a certain strange and ridiculous
conception of truth peculiar to
many persons engaged in the great fields
of our literary criticism and of our publishing
and political activities.
</p>

<p>
This is a conception of truth not at
all as something capable of irradiating
any scene on the globe, like light; but
as some very definite and limited force,
driving a band-wagon. People who
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
possess this conception of truth seem to
argue very reasonably that if Mr. Wells
is &ldquo;in&rdquo; it, so to speak, with truth, and
is saying &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; to say about sex
or about the liberal party, then the intelligent
author anywhere who desires to be
&ldquo;in&rdquo; it with truth will surely get into
this band-wagon of Mr. Wells&rsquo;s and
stand on the very planks he has placed
in the platform of its particular wagonbed.
It is an ironical, if tragic, comment
on the intelligence of American
reading that the driver I have chanced
to see most frequently urged for authors
here should be Mr. H. G. Wells, who
has done probably more than any other
living writer of English to encourage
varied specialistic and non-partisan expression.
</p>

<p>
We have said that to tell his own
truth the American writer will have to
sit longer before his subject and will
have more to do to express it, than if
he chose it from a country of more ancient
practices in art, and of longer
ancestral sojourns. We have said that
he will be urged not to tell his own truth
considerably more than an English or
German or French writer would be.
These authors are at least not advised to
imitate American expression, and they
live in countries where the habit of copying
the work of other artists is much
less widely regarded as an evidence of
sophistication than it is here.
</p>

<p>
The American writer must also face
a marked historical peculiarity of our
national letters. The publishing centres
of England and of Germany and of
France are in the midst of these nations.
Outside the daily press, the
greater part of the publishing business
of our own country is in New York&mdash;situated
in the northeast corner, nearly
a continent away from many of our national
interests and from many millions
of our population. By an odd coincidence,
outside the daily press, the field
of our national letters in magazine and
book publication seems to be occupied
not at all with individual impressions of
truth from over the whole country, but
with what may be called the New York
truth.
</p>

<p>
The young American author in the
Klondike or in San Francisco who desires
to sit long before his subject and
to reveal its hitherto unrecorded aspect
must do so with the clear knowledge
that the field of publication for him in
the East is already filled by our old
friend the New York Klondike, scarcely
changed by the disappearance of one
dog or sweater from the early days of
the gold discoveries; and that no earthquake
has shaken the New York San
Francisco.
</p>

<p>
Of course we know, because she almost
annually reassures the country on these
points, that New York instantly welcomes
all original and fresh writing arising
from the remotest borders of the
nation; and that in all these matters
she is not and never possibly could be
dull. Yet one can understand how the
Klondike author, interested, as Mr. Galsworthy
advises, in seeing an object in
&ldquo;the way that he alone can see it&rdquo; and
&ldquo;with the part of him which makes
him This man and not That,&rdquo; might feel
a trifle dashed by New York&rsquo;s way of
showing her love of originality in spending
nearly all the money and energy her
publishers and reviewers have in advertising
and in praising authors as the sixteenth
Kipling of the Klondike or the
thirtieth O. Henry, of California. This
is apt to be bewildering, too, for the readers
of Mr. Kipling and O. Henry, who
have enjoyed in the tales of each of these
men the truth told &ldquo;with the part of
him which makes him This man and not
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
That.&rdquo; It is possible to understand, too,
how the young author in San Francisco
may feel that since New York&rsquo;s consciousness
of his city has remained virtually
untouched for eight years by the
greatest cataclysm of nature on our continent,
perhaps she overrates the extreme
swiftness and sensitiveness of her
reaction to novel impression from without;
and might conceivably not hear a
story of heretofore unexpressed aspects
of San Francisco told by the truthful
voice of one young writer.
</p>

<p>
These are some of my own guesses as
to why individual impressions of our national
life are few and why they are not
greatly in vogue in America. Whether
they be poor or good guesses they represent
one Middle Western reader&rsquo;s observation
of some of the actual difficulties
that will have to be faced in America
by the writer who by temperament desires
to follow that golden and beautiful
way of Flaubert&rsquo;s, which Mr. Galsworthy
has mentioned.
</p>

<p>
This writer will doubtless get from
these difficulties far more fun than he
ever could have had without them. They
are suggested here in the pages of <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span>, not at all with the idea
of discouraging a single traveler from
setting out on that splendid road, but
rather as a step towards the beginning
of that true and long comradeship with
effort that is worth befriending which
our felicitous English well-wisher hopes
may be <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review&rsquo;s</span> abiding
purpose.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">O</span><span class="postfirstchar">dium</span> theologicum&mdash;it is a
deadly thing. But the ridicule and
obloquy, formerly characteristic of credal
fanaticism, seem to have passed over
in recent years into the camp of art connoisseurs.
No denying it, it was a
Homeric warfare that reverberated up
and down the earth from land to land,
and from century to century, between
what was ever the &ldquo;old&rdquo; faith and the
&ldquo;new.&rdquo; In this year of grace, however,
it is the disciples of &ldquo;classic&rdquo; art&mdash;aureoled
with the sanctity of some antiquity
or idealism&mdash;and &ldquo;modern&rdquo; art&mdash;in
whatever <em>nuance</em> or novelty of most
disapproved and screaming modernity&mdash;who
hereticize each other, who even deny
each other right of domicile, save, perhaps,
in the unvisited solitudes of interstellar
spaces. To be sure, those august
and frozen solitudes of the everlasting
nothing may be conceivably preferable
to the theological <em>Inferno</em>, though probably
this question has not yet received
the attention from critics and philanthropists
that its importance would seem
to merit.
</p>

<p>
At the outset it seemed as if the religious
warfare had a certain advantage
over the esthetic&mdash;it agitated more people,
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
and seized men in their idiomatic and
innermost interests, while, on the other
side, but small and select circles participated
in partisan questions and controversies
respecting art. But it looks now
as if it would soon be the other way
around. The people face religious
problems with less and less sympathy and
understanding. But art, art of some
kind and some degree, they are keenly
alive as to that, and quick to appraise
or to argue. The churches are ever
emptier; the theatres, concert halls,
museums, &ldquo;movies,&rdquo; ever fuller. A religious
book&mdash;short of epoch-making&mdash;finds,
at best, only a reluctant and panicky
publisher; a new play, a new novel,
see how many editions it passes
through, how hard it is to draw at the
libraries, even after the staff and all
their friends and sweethearts have courteously
had first chance at it!
</p>

<p>
Now, it is of no use to quarrel with
this turn matters have taken. And we
miss the mark if we say that it is all
bad. Off moments come to the best of us
when we grow a bit tired of being &ldquo;uplifted&rdquo;
and &ldquo;reformed.&rdquo; Humanity has
turned to art and, in doing so, has, on
some side of its life, moved forward
apace, mounted to higher modes of existence,
and, whether the church knows
it or not, along the steeps of Parnassus
and in the home of the muses has heard
some music and caught some glimpses of
the not too distant fatherland of the
divine and the eternal.
</p>

<p>
First-rate spirits of light and leading
have pointed the way to a new esthetic
culture&mdash;prophetic spirits who in
blackest night when deep sleep had fallen
upon most men saw the rosy-fingered
dawn of our new day. It was to be a
day when beauty should be bidden to
lead the dance at the ball of life. There
were serious philosophers&mdash;there was
Kant, who contemplated art as the keystone
in the sublime structure which modern
knowledge and moral will should
be summoned to erect in life. There
was Schopenhauer, to whom art was the
unveiling of the riddle of the world, the
most intimate revelation of the divine
mystery of life. There was the hero
of Baireuth, who, in his artistic creations,
summed up all the spiritual and
moral forces of humanity, and made
them fruitful for the rebirth and fruition
of our modern day.
</p>

<p>
Among these prophets of a new esthetic
culture, <em>Friedrich Nietzsche</em> occupies
a quite special place, and influences
the course of coming events. As a most
enthusiastic apostle of the gospel of a
world-redeeming art he first flung his
fire-brand into the land, but only to
scorn and blaspheme soon thereafter the
very gods he had formerly so passionately
worshipped; now degrading them
to idols. His faith in art, not this art
or that, but in all art, in art as such,
pathetically wavered. Still the artist
in him himself did not die; its eye was
undimmed and its bow abode in strength.
And though he later confronted every
work of art with a malevolent and exasperating
interrogation, all this was
only his pure and pellucid soul wrestling
for better and surer values, for new and
nobler revelations, of the artistic genius.
Indeed, it was precisely in these interrogations
that he was at once our liberator
and our leader&mdash;our liberator from the
frenzy into which the overfoaming enthusiasm
as regards art had transported
men; our leader to a livelier, loftier
beauty summoned to the creation of the
humanest, divinest robes for the adornment
of humanity as a whole.
</p>

<p>
The great movement and seething in
the artistic life of our age signifies at
the same time a turning point in our
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
entire cultural life. This turning point
discloses new perspective into vast illimitable
distances where new victories are
to be achieved by new struggles. The
great diremption in our present world,
making men sick and weak, calling for
relaxation and convalescence, appears at
a definite stage as the opposition between
life and art. Life is serious, art is
gay&mdash;so were we taught. Seriousness
and gaiety&mdash;it was the fatality of our
time that these could not be combined.
So art and life were torn asunder. Art
was no serious matter, no vital matter,
satisfying a true and necessary human
requirement. Art was a luxury, a sport,
and since but few men were in a position
to avail themselves of such luxury,
art came to be the prerogative of a few
rich people. Down at the bottom, in
homes of want and misery, life&rsquo;s tragedies
were real and fearful; life was real,
indeed, life was earnest, indeed; at the
top, however, pleasures claimed the
senses and thoughts of men; so much
so, that even tragedies served but to
amuse; tragedies were an illusion of the
senses, not realities of life and pain.
What God had joined together man had
put asunder&mdash;and there was art without
life, life without art, and both art and
life suffering from ailments which neither
understood.
</p>

<p>
There was a time when men worked,
too, but it was a beautiful halcyon time,
when pleasure and joy throbbed in the
very heart of the work itself; when a
sunny serenity suffused life&rsquo;s profoundest
seriousness. Art pervaded all life,
active in all man&rsquo;s activities, present in
every nook and corner whither his vagrant
feet wandered. Indeed, art was
the very life of man, revealing his
strength, his freedom, his creativeness,
with which he fashioned things after his
own image and according to his own likeness.
Every craftsman was an artist,
every peasant a poet. Man put his soul
into all that he said and did, all that
he lived; his work was a work of art,
his speech a song, his life beauty. No
man lived by bread alone; everyone
heard and had a word that was the True
Bread. His cathedrals&mdash;domes of
many-colored glass&mdash;preached it to
him; his actors sang it to him; even
his priests were artists. With a sort of
divine humor, man thus subjected to
himself all the anxiety and need of life.
</p>

<p>
Then, later, man came to think that
he could live by bread alone. Even the
True Bread came to be mere bread&mdash;public
influence; political power. And
then man&rsquo;s poor soul hungered. And
when he longed for a Living Word
that was not mere bread, he was given
printer&rsquo;s ink and the &ldquo;sacred letter&rdquo; of
the Bible. But this&mdash;ah, this was no
soul&rsquo;s food. So the soul lost its soul.
Then, as man had no soul to work with,
he had to work with his head, his arms,
his feet. Man ceased to be an artist
who breathes his living soul into his
life, an artist who illumined all the seriousness
of life with the sunshine of his
living love. Would he art, he could not
make it, he had to buy it. Could he not
buy it, he had to do without it. Thus,
life became as jejune and rational as
a Protestant service, where, to be sure,
there was no priest more, but also no
artist, only scribe and theologian&mdash;where
religion became dogmatics, faith
a sum in arithmetic, Christianity a documentarily
deposited judicial process between
God and man. To be sure, under
certain circumstances, decoration and
color, even pomp and magnificence, may
be found in this church, but no living
connection between the outward appearance
of these churches and their inner
and peculiar service. Thus, too, our
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
private dwellings have lost living union
between their appointments and their
inmates. What all are curious to know
about these houses is whether the men
who dwell in them are rich or poor, not
whether they have souls, and what lives
in their souls, should they have any.
</p>

<p>
And because art had no soul of its own
more, it became patronizing and mendicant&mdash;coquetting
for the favors of the
rich and powerful, sitting at their tables,
perhaps even picking up the crumbs that
fall beneath the tables. Art, ah, art sought
bread&mdash;mere bread&mdash;and adopted the
sorry principle that to get bread was the
sacredest of all duties.
</p>

<p>
Art without life, life without art!
Then came that mighty movement of
spirits to bring art and life together
again, to reconquer and recreate and reestablish
a view of life in which man
should learn to see and achieve beauty
once yet again. Of that movement,
Friedrich Nietzsche was the purest and
intensest herald. Bold, fiery spirit, with
words that burn, he uttered what had
been for a long time a soul-burden of
all deeper spirits. This burden of souls
was that an art creation should go on in
every human life as its highest and holiest
calling; that, without the living effectuation
of the artistic power of the human
soul, all human culture would serve but
beastliness and barbarity.
</p>

<p>
To this end our poet-philosopher returns
to the <em>Urgrund</em>, the abyss of nature&rsquo;s
life, from whose mysterious deep
all tempestuous, wild impulses tumble
forth and struggle for form and expression
in man. It is life which seeks
death in order to renew itself in the painful
pleasure of its destruction, perceived
but then by man in the thrill of delight
which prepares the way for his most
original eternal revelation. To breed
pleasure from pain; to suck forces of
life from the most shocking tragedies;
to eavesdrop on the brink of the abysmal
so as to fashion sweet phantoms in
the divine intoxication of the soul,&mdash;this
is music, this is art, in this, man
struggles beyond and above his whole
contradictory nature, transfigures death,
creates forms and figures in which he
celebrates his self-redemption from seriousness,
from the curse of existence.
Here, at last, art is no sport, no fiddle-faddle,
but at once highest and gayest
seriousness. It returns from the service
of death which it has performed, to
its life, which it receives from &ldquo;every
word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
God.&rdquo; Herein lies the over-powering, the
prophetic, in this Nietzschean preaching
of art. It tells us that we are very far
from comprehending life when we have
but measured its length and breadth
with yardstick and square; that nature
is far different from what scholars have
figured it out to be, or from what investigators
have seen of it with telescope
and microscope. It teaches us to listen
to the old eternal murmurs of the spirit,
whose sigh we hear indeed, but whence
it comes and whither it goes we never
know&mdash;murmurs and sighs which bring
forth the elementary forces, instincts,
passions, and friendships in man, which
men fashion and shape, regulate and
direct indeed, but whose coming and
going, whose ebbing and flowing, is not
within their power. Inspiration, divine
in-breathing&mdash;a dead concept as applied
by theologians to their Bible&mdash;comes
into its own again in human nature
as a whole, it is the true element in
man&rsquo;s life, by virtue of which the soul
feels within itself a creative life&mdash;its
own proof that its dependence is no
slave-service, but freedom; that its deepest
suffering of pain is itself creative life,
creative pleasure.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
Is it, now, the tragic fatality of a
sick soul, is it the demoniac play of a
spirit of negation when precisely the
very preacher of this grandiose art-prophecy
goes astray in his own preaching,
when he finally thrusts it from him,
with shrill laughter? The poet-philosopher
begins <em>to think</em> concerning his
preaching! Art makes the thinker&rsquo;s
heart heavy! Art ever speaks a language
which thought cannot express.
Art strikes chords in the human heart,
and there are at once intimations of a
Beyond of all thought. And the thinker
of today has bidden good-bye to every
Beyond of his thought. Nothing unthinkable
was to be left for the feelings.
So the thinker felt a stab in every art
for his thinker&rsquo;s heart, a doubt whether
he should hold fast to the incomprehensible
or sell himself to the devil of the
universally comprehensible. And this
doubt becomes an open confession of sin
in the Zarathustra poesy: poets&mdash;and
Zarathustra himself was a poet&mdash;lie too
much! It is adulterated wine which they
set before the thirsty. They muddy all
their streams so that they shall appear
deep. Into the kingdom of clouds they
go, and build their air-castles on all too
airy foundations. Thus, Zarathustra,
poet, grows weary of their lies; he is
a bit tired even of himself. And so,
now, this doubt-respecting art slips into
the soul of even its most enthusiastic
prophets&mdash;nor are they the worst artists
at whose souls these doubts gnaw!
To create a beautiful culture in which
man shall receive a higher revelation of
life, and mount to a higher stage of his
development, to <em>this</em>, art which receives
its consecration in dizziness and dream, is
not yet called. In fact, these artists do
lie too much! They seek life indeed,
they hunger for life; but, because life
is too living to them, too natural, they
create an artificial glow in whose heat
they think they first have life. Thus,
the second deception becomes worse than
the first. The devil of matter-of-fact
prose is driven out by the beelzebub of
over-stimulated nerves, and men flee from
the monotony of every-day life to the
refinement of sensibility, which art shall
superinduce. <em>Poets</em> do lie too much, not
because they tell us fairy tales&mdash;fairy
tales could be the beautifulest, holiest
truths! But because they simulate feelings
they do not have&mdash;feelings which
arise in them not naturally but narcotically!
<em>Sculptors</em>, <em>painters</em>, do lie too
much, not because they create forms and
colors which no man&rsquo;s eyes have ever
seen, but because they create their own
selves unfaithfully&mdash;an alien life which
they have somewhere inoculated themselves
with and given out as their own.
Even <em>architects</em> lie too much, because
they compel their works to speak a foreign
language, as if stone should be
ashamed to speak as stone, wood as wood,
iron as iron!
</p>

<p>
The Nietzschean doubt respecting art&mdash;today
this has become a demand for
<em>truth in art</em> and for <em>truthfulness in the
artist</em>! And from these a third&mdash;the
demand for <em>simplicity</em>! And all this is
of a piece with the purpose to live a
<em>simple</em> life.
</p>

<p>
Man does not live by bread alone. It
is a living question for the sake of
future humanity that our art shall give
the True Bread to the heart of man, so
that we may form a life in us and around
us, a life whereon shall not repose the
dead weight of a culture artificially burdened
with a thousand anxieties and
cares, but a life wherein man shall
breathe freer, because he breathes the
fresh free air of life itself. Beautiful
life, artistic culture; this means the opposite
of what many mean by it today&mdash;it
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
means, not upholstered chairs, not more
cushions and carpets, not motlier pictures
on the walls, and not a pleroma of all
varieties of ornaments overloading stands
and tables, but it means a life full of soul,
warm with the sunshine of love, it means
that all man does, all that environs him,
shall find through eye and ear the mystic
pathway to the heart, to bear witness
there of a joy and an ardor, of a freedom
and a truth, inspiring men to cry: It
is good to be here, let us build tabernacles!
For such beautiful life, so little is
required, yet so much! So little sumptuousness,
so much soul! So little money,
so much man!

&ldquo;Change&rdquo; at the Fine Arts Theatre
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">DeWitt C. Wing</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">Y</span><span class="postfirstchar">our</span> enthusiastic welcome of
<em>Change</em>, published in the April
number of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>, compelled
me to see the play, and I hasten to
report a memorable evening. Have you
ever heard the hard, sharp, battering,
hammering of an electric riveter used
on a steel bridge? <em>Change</em> has a punch
like that, and every punch is a puncture.
No kind of orthodoxy can resist it.
</p>

<p>
I have never spent a dozy moment in
the Fine Arts Theatre. I shall never
forget <em>Candida</em>, <em>Hindle Wakes</em>, <em>Miles
Dixon</em>, <em>Prunella</em>, <em>Change</em>, and other
dramas and tragedies that I have witnessed
there. I shall not even forget
<em>Cowards</em>. Chicago some day will reproduce
and expand the truth which a dozen
plays have driven into the souls of
people who have sat in that beautiful
little room. Whatever the commercial
outcome of an attempt to present beauty
and truth as expressions of life, the management
has already achieved a noble
success. Hundreds of men and women
will always remember the Fine Arts Theatre
as an inner shrine of authentic art,
where the furthermost reaches of the
human spirit in the fiction of plays have
touched and quickened the heart of
reality.
</p>

<p>
<em>Change</em> represents an ever-new voice
rising above the rattle of inevitable
dogma and decay. It rings true to life.
Even its name is profoundly appropriate
as a label for an inexorable law. If a
play reveals splendid thinking I am
almost indifferent to what in that case
becomes largely the incident of acting,
for to be engrossed in enforced thought
is to lose that narrow vision of the outward
eye which merely looks on a performance.
One is not then an onlooker
but a discoverer. <em>Change</em> was hard,
subtle thinking plus admirable interpretative
acting. Like the Irish and English
players who have appeared in the
Fine Arts Theatre, the Welsh company
who recently gave us this trenchant criticism
of life endowed the word &ldquo;acting&rdquo;
with a fresh significance. One does not
think of them as players; they impress
one as re-livers of the life that they portray.
That is art of a high order. If
we Americans are proud of our wealth
and wonders, we must bow in humility
when we consider that the biggest plays
that we have seen and the best acting
that we have witnessed are not of domestic
authorship. They are imported, and
we have enjoyed them at the Fine Arts
Theatre in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
<em>Change</em> is in four acts, written by
J. O. Francis. It was awarded the prize
offered by the Incorporated Stage Society
of London for the best play of the
season. The scene is in a cottage on the
Twmp, Aberpandy, in South Wales.
The time is the present. A tragic
change occurs in a family, whose head
was a collier. It is a kind of drama that
might inspire the private regret that the
tragic martyrdom of Christian fanatics
is no longer in vogue, and offers a species
of justification of summarily removing
human obstacles. Who among
real men wouldn&rsquo;t have an impulse to
take an active hand in ridding life of a
suppressive old barnacle like John
Price? He and his conscience and his
God stood against the primal law of
change, with blind passion and colossal
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
selfishness. If his sons John Henry and
Lewis had mangled him I should have
admired their passion. Gwen Price, the
wife and mother, suffered more than all
because she was capable of suffering;
I did not wish a change on her account;
she was a woman. Her suffering and
weakness were her triumph and strength.
Besides, she was not at war with life as
she saw it in her sons. Her love was
great and wise enough to confer tragic
beauty and adorn a soul; that kind of
love is the supreme religion.
</p>

<p>
What John Price felt and expressed
as religion was a contemptible mental
narrowness and spiritual poverty; a
counterfeit religion based upon fear and
hardened by ceremonial practice. Its one
virtue was that it offered the most formidable
opposition to the unfolding of
manhood in two young men. Youth is
ever pushing its entangled feet down
against the hard substrata of anterior
generations. Too often it is stuck and
gradually smothered in the upper mud,
which solidifies as insidiously as it forms.
A man who can be held by dying or dead
impedimenta is himself dead. A man
who struggles out and stands triumphant
upon it, with the antennae of his
being reaching up and out for the widest
and finest contacts, fulfills destiny by
adding a golden grain of solid value on
which a succeeding aspirant for a larger
life may stand that much higher on the
old foundation. The man who conforms,
remains in and a part of the common
level, plastically flattens out like dough
under a rolling pin, merely fulfills the
law of the indestructibility of matter
and the conservation of mass. Whereas
youth&rsquo;s great dream is symbolized by the
over-topping king of the forest, standing
stiff-spined and straight upon the
old earth, its head in rare aloofness, the
ease-lover functions as a lowly parasite.
</p>

<p>
With wild winged thoughts of which
these remarks are vague memories I took
<em>Change</em> in my consciousness from the
theatre. No thoughtful person could
have returned unchanged from the playhouse.
The transitoriness of religions,
institutions, customs, and all other so-called
fixtures which constitute modern
civilization is the tremendous fact that
makes <em>Change</em> a powerful supplement to
social forces. Of course to the modern
mind the idea is already old, but to the
primitive majority it is a prophecy.
</p>

<p>
The author tempered his mild radicalism
with the hard-headed sagacity of
Sam Thatcher, a one-armed pointsman,
who, while unintellectually aware of the
changelessness of change, &ldquo;figured it
out&rdquo; that life is cyclic; that as experience
broadens the attitudes of men <a id="corr-4"></a>they lose
their little individualities in a common
resignation, defeat, and decay, which to
him meant contentment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
round the world some&mdash;round and
round. That&rsquo;s how things go&mdash;round
and round&mdash;I know, round and round.&rdquo;
Sam thus epitomized an old theory which
has so many supporters that it must be
wrong. But if we do not go &ldquo;round
and round&rdquo; in what direction do we go?
Nobody knows. If our movement is circular
there is the desperate possibility
of sufficient momentum to gain new territory
by virtue of centrifugal force.
We can at least make the circle larger.
Races have bloomed, fruited, and passed;
planets have shone for an abbreviated
eternity and disappeared; baffling facts
about life-forms upon the earth have
come to light. Our conscious life is
young, densely ignorant, and full of
pain; our instinctive life is ageless, has
perfected its knowledge and can endure,
as it has endured, the aeons of change.
We shall some day get the idea of change
into our consciousness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
Unthinkingly one might regret that
Sam was clever enough to sway back toward
dogma those wavering minds which
might otherwise have yielded to the
drama&rsquo;s punches. But his pathetically
amusing romance should have made it
clear to respectable auditors flirting with
new ideas that he was not a competent
critic of their particular class-slice of
life. What he said was reassuring, assuaging,
brilliantly trite, and an untroubled
mind would take it and reject
the austere, burning truth of the essential
message of the play.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Naught may endure but mutability&rdquo;:
Shelley thus expressed what every
educated man knows. Change is the unvarying
order, and yet we are constitutionally
averse to it. Comfortable people
dislike it. &ldquo;All great natures love stability.&rdquo;
Why do we make John Prices
of ourselves? (I think that H. G. Wells,
more than any other literary man, has
lived in consonance with the law of
change.) An expanding knowledge precludes
constancy. All John Prices are
obscurantists. Convictions and blind
faith based upon glorified ignorance
have for thousands of years encysted,
cramped, and twisted personal life, but
somehow it has burst through the fetters
and arrayed itself for successive
struggles. Analyzing what we see and
know, and confessing what we think we
feel, we have the ancient riddle before
us. We applaud a play like <em>Change</em>, but
seek security and stability in every relationship.
Eventually every man must
feel what Rousseau wrote: &ldquo;Everything
in this world is a tangled yarn; we taste
nothing in its purity, we do not remain
two moments in the same state. Our
affections, as well as bodies, are in perpetual
flux.&rdquo; Maybe Sam Thatcher was
wise, but if we knew that our life were
cyclic the joy of it to us would cease.
The wiser man does not know so much
as Sam professed, but his endless endeavor
is to try to know more. The
law of change, which he sees enforced
everywhere, increases his insatiability.
</p>

<p>
It is ultimate questions to which
<em>Change</em> gives rise, and to such questions
there are no satisfactory answers. The
social value of the play lies in the
graphic clearness with which it illustrates
the slow but epochal shifts that are
always under way in thinking individuals,
families, and nations.
</p>

<p>
There is no Rock of Ages in the land
of courageous knowledge. Nothing endures
but mutability. The purpose of a
play like <em>Change</em> is to open the inner
mind to this glorious truth, so that with
a fortitude born of understanding we
may accept misfortune, calamity, and
death as the effects of unalterable law,
and not as donated penalties or inscrutable
accidents. Poise, power, and personality
are the fruits of this attitude
toward change, and whoever achieves
these has climbed out of the &ldquo;reddest
hell&rdquo;

<h3 class="section" id="THE_VISION_OF_WELLS">
The Vision of Wells
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
I should like to set &ldquo;M. M.&rsquo;s&rdquo;
mind at rest about H. G. Wells, but
I can&rsquo;t quite understand what her objection
to him really is. She seems to be in
what the charming little old Victorian
lady would have called &ldquo;a state of
mind.&rdquo; Something about Wells annoys
her; she hasn&rsquo;t thought it out clearly,
but she raps Wells wherever she can get
at him, as a sort of personal revenge for
her discomfort.
</p>

<p>
Suppose, for the sake of argument,
that the passage she quotes from the
hero really represents Wells&rsquo;s feeling
about the relations between the sexes.
He believes that &ldquo;<em>under existing conditions</em>&rdquo;
there is always danger of love
between men and women unless the man
has one sole woman intimate, and lets &ldquo;a
superficial friendship toward all other
women veil impassable abysses of separation.&rdquo;
&ldquo;M. M.&rdquo; wisely admits the
truth of that&mdash;in fact, it&rsquo;s the most
obvious of truisms. Then the hero&mdash;or
Wells&mdash;goes on to say that this, to him,
is an intolerable state of affairs. For
this &ldquo;M. M.&rdquo; calls him &ldquo;wicked,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Mr. M. M.&rdquo; accuses him of not being
busy enough, and of not working for a
living.
</p>

<p>
I wonder if &ldquo;M. M.&rdquo; stopped to think
exactly why the hero considers this an
intolerable state of affairs. The statement
means nothing more than that the
man would like to have intimate friendships
with more than one woman. He
doesn&rsquo;t say he wants to love more than
one woman. Well, it is easily conceivable
that a man of active mind and companionability
would like to have some
degree of intimacy with various women.
There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anything wicked
about that, and it&rsquo;s possible that he
should feel so even if he was &ldquo;working
for a living.&rdquo; If we confine ourselves to
one intimacy, we&rsquo;re likely to lose the
full relish of it before many years. The
thought of that is certainly intolerable.
A man who is close to a good many
people is usually better fitted to appreciate
his best friend. A woman novelist
who has a conspicuously successful marriage
put it well the other day. &ldquo;If you
go into a room where there is a bunch of
violets,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are charmed by
the odor. If you stay in the room all
the time, you forget about the odor&mdash;or
it bores you. But if you are continually
going out and coming in again,
it greets you every time, and you learn
to appreciate its subtleties.&rdquo; Perhaps
&ldquo;M. M.&rdquo; thinks that reason is begging
the question. Well, take the other side.
Any human being who is expanding has
an insatiable desire for new experience,
new knowledge. That is the healthiest
instinct in mankind. Such a person would
naturally fret at the inability to be intimate
with a new acquaintance who interests
him. That feeling would not be
wicked; it would be right, by any sane
standard.
</p>

<p>
Forgive the blatant obviousness of all
this. But I&rsquo;m bent on carrying through
the discussion to the end. Granted, then,
that our hero&rsquo;s feeling is not intrinsically
wicked&mdash;what then? He faces a
dilemma. Either he must run the risk
of a new love affair, or&mdash;and this, I
think, escaped &ldquo;M. M.&rdquo;&mdash;present conditions
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
must be changed. If he has a new
love affair, he is at the least violating the
Victorian lady&rsquo;s conventional morality,
which says that every man must love not
more than one woman as long as that
woman lives. We come then to an extremely
vital problem. On the one hand,
is conventional morality desirable? On
the other, can present conditions be so
changed as to eliminate the danger? The
solution of that problem is of great importance
to anyone interested in human
beings. If it can&rsquo;t be solved, it means
that the man or woman must quench a
right and healthy instinct along whichever
line he or she chooses. And that&rsquo;s
a bit of pessimism which a warm-hearted
man like H. G. Wells doesn&rsquo;t want to
accept without further investigation.
That&rsquo;s the reason he wrote <em>The Passionate
Friends</em>. He is engaged in the noble
endeavor to do something at least toward
freeing the great spirit of mankind from
the network in which it is enmeshed.
The history of that struggle is the history
of human progress.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it isn&rsquo;t necessary further to
defend Mr. Wells for the sort of novels
he writes. But I&rsquo;d like to offer an illustration
of the difference between Wells
and the old-fashioned novelist. The old
writer started with the conviction that
certain laws and fundamental conditions
were forever fixed, and must limit the
destinies of his characters. He then
works out his little story according to
rules, and gets his effect by arousing in
us pity for the misfortunes, hatred for
the sins, and joy for the virtuous triumphs
of his people. The tendency of
the whole was to show us once more
what the eternal verities were&mdash;and the
result was highly &ldquo;moral.&rdquo; Every character
was an object lesson. Wells, on
the other hand, is not a preacher, but a
scientist. He starts with the conviction
that, through lack of impartial investigation,
we don&rsquo;t really know what the
eternal verities are, or what power can
be derived from them. His attitude is
as far from the old writers&rsquo; as is Mme.
Curie&rsquo;s from the alchemists&rsquo;. He attempts
to free his mind from every prejudice.
Then he begins his experiment,
puts his characters in their retort under
&ldquo;controlled conditions,&rdquo; and <em>watches
what happens</em>. What his characters do
corresponds to fact as well as his trained
mind can make it. The result may be
negative or positive&mdash;but at least it is
true, and, like all truth, it is really valuable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;M. M.&rdquo; prejudges the case when she
talks about denial, and building up character,
and loyalty, and unselfishness.
These things may demand her conclusion,
and again they may not. At best
they are means to an end. She may be
right. But Wells is going ahead to find
out. He isn&rsquo;t arguing for anything.
We may be denying something we ought
to have; we may be building the wrong
kind of character; we may be loyal to
a false principle; we may be unselfish
with evil result. But if we cease to
becloud the issue, and watch carefully
the experiment of Mr. Wells and his
followers, we shall know more about it
than we do.
</p>

<p>
And, for a general toning of her mind,
I should like to ask &ldquo;M. M.&rdquo; to read
<em>The Death of Eve</em>, by William Vaughn
Moody, to pay particular attention to
the majestic song of Eve in the garden,
and after she has felt the tremendous
impulse of that line&mdash;

<h3 class="section" id="ANOTHER_VIEW_OF_THE_DARK_FLOWER">
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
Another View of &ldquo;The Dark Flower&rdquo;
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
It is with no desire to be carping that
I offer this criticism of <em>The Dark
Flower</em>, for I, too, am a devoted disciple
who hangs on the master&rsquo;s lips; but
being a skeptical modern woman withal,
I am not abject. Perhaps we should be
satisfied with what Galsworthy has given
us&mdash;this searching vision into the soul
of a rarely sensitive man. The writing
of it&mdash;what we term style&mdash;is beyond
doubt Galsworthy&rsquo;s most distinguished
performance, far more poetical than any
of his verse. Its material is invaluable
for its sheer honesty as well as its sheer
beauty. Its reality and intimacy are
grippingly poignant. And yet how account
for the pain of futility which
sweeps over you as you close the book,
drowning for the time the ecstasy of
high joy in all its beauty? It is as if
the heavy aroma of autumn&rsquo;s decay had
invaded a garden in early spring.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there is something essentially futile
about <em>The Dark Flower</em>. It lies so
hidden in the warp and woof of the
whole fabric that the casual reader passes
it over unseen. I can best explain by
referring to the novel itself. Each of
the three episodes deals with Mark Lennan&rsquo;s
passion for a woman: in his youth
for an older woman, in his maturity for
a woman his own age, in his approaching
autumn for a young girl. And in all
three passion&mdash;the great primal force&mdash;is
made an illicit emotion. In the first
two episodes the women are married; in
the last, Lennan is. It is scarcely by
chance that Lennan&rsquo;s loves were unlawful;
on the contrary, a symbolic significance
seems to be intended, that passion
is natural, free, coming and going by
tides unbound by man&rsquo;s will or law. But
if that was Galsworthy&rsquo;s aim, he has run
an unnecessary stretch beyond his goal.
By his over-emphasis, passion becomes
purposefully illicit, voluntarily seeking
out the forbidden object and the secret
passage. And instead of being the priceless
inheritance from a free God, passion
becomes an ailment laid upon us by some
designing fate.
</p>

<p>
And now glance at the dénouement
of each episode. In the first it is the
woman who closes the little drama; Mark
merely watches her go. In the second
the woman&rsquo;s husband kills her, and Mark
is left dazed. In the last his wife steps
in and turns the current of events. Always
an extraneous force makes the decision
for him. He is never permitted to
grapple with the situation created. Galsworthy
forever extricates him. Not once
is his passion allowed to run its course.
Each experience is abortive. If I had
been Mark Lennan I should have been
tempted to curse the meddling fate that
insisted upon rescuing me just before I
jumped.
</p>

<p>
No, a woman would not have had her
perfect moment with Mark Lennan, but
only the promise of it.
</p>

<p>
Mark is a futile person; his love life
a procession of futile experiences. But
in spite of its futility it is an exquisite
record for which I whole-heartedly give
thanks.

<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
Dr. Foster&rsquo;s Articles on Nietzsche
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
M. H. P.&rsquo;s remarks in &ldquo;The Critics&rsquo;
Critic&rdquo; of the April number of <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span> on Dr. George Burman
Foster&rsquo;s paper entitled &ldquo;The Prophet of
a New Culture&rdquo; in the March issue induced
me to give that notable article a
third reading. M. H. P. says &ldquo;...
there&rsquo;s ... too much enthusiasm to be
borne out by what he actually says,&rdquo; and
then asks the author, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you forget
a little of this sound and fury and tell
us as simply as you can just what it is
that you want us to do?&rdquo; This obviously
tired and disturbed &ldquo;critic&rdquo; continues:
&ldquo;... I have a feeling that
pure enthusiasm, wasting itself in little
geysers, is intrinsically ridiculous. Enthusiasm
should grow trees and put
magic in violets&mdash;and that can&rsquo;t be done
with undue quickness, or in any but the
most simple way. Nobody cares about
the sap except for what it does.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This irrelevant criticism is an intellectually
lazy protest of a sensuous, self-styled
&ldquo;healthy&rdquo; person blundering
through an interpretative analysis of
hard, serious thought, expecting to find
a program or a plan, cut and dried,
ready for the seekers of a new culture.
Dr. Foster properly avoided making any
definite proposals based upon his study
of Nietzsche. With a contagious enthusiasm
he wrote his own response to
Nietzsche&rsquo;s attitude toward the universe.
To condemn his animation is barbaric
stupidity. He probably was not conscious
when he wrote the paper that anybody
wanted him to outline in desiccated
phrases a scheme to crystallize the Nietzschean
philosophy into personal or social
action. He was fired by his subject, and
his function&mdash;I do not say his purpose&mdash;was
to spread the flame. The depths
of feeling must be reached before action
can be more than an abortion of the
mind. Dr. Foster&rsquo;s serious, almost sad,
enthusiasm, makes the spirit of Nietzsche
arouse feeling, and feeling underlies
every organic social action. It is
not what <em>he</em> &ldquo;actually says&rdquo; but what
Nietzsche says <em>to</em> him that explains and
justifies Dr. Foster&rsquo;s enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
An incoherent generalization like
&ldquo;pure enthusiasm wasting itself in little
geysers is intrinsically ridiculous&rdquo; is a
part of the typical literary method of
veneering ignorance or prejudices. For
a critic who asks &ldquo;what is it that you
want us to do?&rdquo; which is the desperate
voice of an imitationist, and then talks
glibly of &ldquo;pure enthusiasm,&rdquo; which is
gaseous rhetoric, I have neither respect
nor compassion. What <em>is</em> &ldquo;pure enthusiasm&rdquo;?
</p>

<p>
M. H. P.&rsquo;s objection to &ldquo;sound and
fury,&rdquo; which he associates with &ldquo;political
speeches&rdquo; &ldquo;for a major prophet,&rdquo;
clearly is attributable to a temperamental
inability to understand Nietzsche or emotionally
to respond to his dynamic appeal
to intelligence. A &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; critic&mdash;was
there ever one?&mdash;is a myth, or
a morbidly self-conscious person whose
striving after &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; attitudes is
an infallible sign of disease at the top.
Such a person is pathologically interesting,
but in the realm of philosophical
criticism he is incompetent. I should expect
him to demand that &ldquo;enthusiasm
should grow trees and put magic in
violets&rdquo;&mdash;which is a ridiculous horticulture.
To limit enthusiasm to so definite
a purpose as this is to affect a poetic
attitude whose labored simplicity has
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
nothing in common with the magic of
violets.
</p>

<p>
Your critic, who has a mania for &ldquo;the
most simple way,&rdquo; is aware of his own
amorphous complexity, and demands that
thinkers and writers be specific, calm,
easy, leisurely, &ldquo;healthy,&rdquo; and lucid,
thereby economizing his unhealthy distress.
For him, Nietzsche has no message,
and upon him Dr. Foster&rsquo;s enthusiasm
is wasted. To him &ldquo;sound and
fury&rdquo; exist where to Nietzsche&rsquo;s &ldquo;preordained
readers&rdquo; there is the new music
of truth. It is that deep harmony which
ran in legitimate fury through the remarkable
article contributed by Dr. Foster.
&ldquo;Nietzsche was a Knight of the
Future.&rdquo; This sentence from the article
bears interestingly upon M. H. P.&rsquo;s allegation
of &ldquo;undue quickness&rdquo; in what
the author expects from the adoption of
the Nietzschean view of life. As for
nobody caring about the sap, I should
say that if he have an enthusiasm for
growing trees and putting magic in violets
he will, perforce, have that care for
the sap which conditions the strength of
the tree and the magic of the violet.
Nietzsche&rsquo;s superman is not to be
achieved in a society that cares nothing
about the sap.
</p>

<p>
Whoever reads Nietzsche and Whitman
&ldquo;slowly, profoundly, attentively,
prudently, with inner thoughts, with
mental doors ajar, with delicate fingers
and eyes,&rdquo; will be better qualified than
M. H. P. to serve as a critic of articles
like Dr. Foster&rsquo;s. Why not call it &ldquo;the
critics&rsquo; gossip&rdquo;?

In a little while he will reach out to the other
planets, and take the greater fire, the sun, into
his service. He will bring his solvent intelligence
to bear upon the riddles of his individual
interaction, transmute jealousy and every passion,
control his own increase, select and breed
for his embodiment a continually finer and
stronger and wiser race. What none of us can
think or will, save in a disconnected partiality,
he will think and will collectively. Already
some of us feel our merger with that greater
life. There come moments when the thing
shines out upon our thoughts. Sometimes in
the dark, sleepless solitudes of night one ceases
to be so-and-so, one ceases to bear a proper
name, forgets one&rsquo;s quarrels and vanities, forgives
and understands one&rsquo;s enemies and oneself,
as one forgives and understands the quarrels

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Eunice Tietjens</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">P</span><span class="postfirstchar">aris,</span> the iridescent dream of every
struggling art student on the round
world; Paris the sophisticated, the most
provincial of all cities&mdash;as provincial
as Athens of old in the sense that she is
complacently sufficient to herself and all
the world else may wag as it will, since
she cares for nothing that does not happen
on a few square miles of soil beside
the Seine; Paris the proud, the difficult;&mdash;Paris
has recently done the one
thing that could be surprising from her.
She has laid aside her prejudices and her
pride and has awarded to a foreigner&mdash;and
that foreigner an American&mdash;the
most coveted prize in the whole realm
of painting. She has given to Lawton
Parker of Chicago the first medal at the
Old Salon.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto it has been an unwritten law
that the first medal was not to go out of
France. The most ambitious American
student, dreaming in his little atelier high
up among the pigeons, over fifty centimes&rsquo;
worth of roast rabbit from the
<em>rôtisserie</em> and a glass of <em>vin ordinaire</em>,
never has dared even to dream of a first
medal. A second has been the height of
his wildest hopes. Ten times only since
the foundation of the Old Salon has a
second medal, of which more than one
is given each year, been awarded to an
American. Sargent had one. Mary
Green Blumenschein, H. O. Tanner,
Manuel Barthold, Robert Mac Cameron,
Aston Knight, the son of Ridgeway
Knight, and Richard E. Miller are among
the others so honored. Gari Melchers
and Frederick MacMonnies have had a
third medal.
</p>

<p>
Now Lawton Parker has carried off
the first! Even for a Frenchman this is
an extraordinary honor. It is kept for
paintings of most unusual merit, and
often no work of the many thousands
submitted is considered worthy of the
honor. At least four Salons have passed
without the award being made at all.
</p>

<p>
The painting with which Mr. Parker
has enchanted Paris is called <em>Paresse</em>, or
<em>Indolence</em>. It is a picture of a nude
model resting on a couch. She lies perfectly
relaxed, her body twisted a little
and one arm raised behind her head.
The delicate flesh tones are outlined
against pale draperies, mauve, gray, and
light yellow. The whole composition is
in a very high key, the red hair of the
girl being the strongest note in the
picture.
</p>

<p>
But it is the lighting which seems most
strongly to have impressed the French
critics. More than forty reviews in
Europe have contained favorable accounts
of this painting, and they have
been unanimous in their praise of the
effects of lighting. Indeed, they have
almost exhausted the vocabulary in their
efforts to describe it. It is the light of
a gray day filtered through a Venetian
blind, and the picture&rsquo;s most puissant
charm lies in the way Mr. Parker has
caught the delicate and subtle values of
this lighting. &ldquo;Delicate, nebulous, pale,
sifted, intimate, tender, harmonious&rdquo;&mdash;these
are some of the adjectives used by
the French reviewers to describe it.
</p>

<p>
All this is, however, built on a foundation
of solid knowledge. Mr. Parker is
an excellent draughtsman and understands
thoroughly the possibilities and
limitations of his medium. He has long
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
been known among the artists in the
Quarter as the most scientific of them all.
The chemical composition of the colors,
their action and interaction, and the result
of time on their brilliancy&mdash;these
Mr. Parker has studied minutely. It is
a subject with which the old masters were
thoroughly familiar, but which painters
of today too often neglect.
</p>

<p>
Sanity is one of the chief characteristics
of Mr. Parker&rsquo;s work. This is a
day of extravagance, of cutting loose
from all ties that bind us to the past.
In Paris the academies are virtually emptied
of students, that the young men may
search for individuality in their own little
ateliers. The Cubists and the Futurists
are the flowering of the tree of experimentation
that has thrust its roots even
into the most academic of sanctuaries.
Many a promising young man has lost
his head entirely. But Lawton Parker
has succeeded in keeping his.
</p>

<p>
He has gone forward with his day, but
not blindly. He has carefully tested
each step as he came to it, and has
stopped short where sanity stopped. The
old virtues of draughtsmanship, composition,
and color he has kept. But he
has added thereto the modern discoveries
in the treatment of light.
</p>

<p>
He and his colleagues, the little group
of painters called the Giverny school, are
already known as Luminists. Frederick
C. Frieseke, Richard E. Miller, and Karl
Anderson belong to this group. During
the summer months they paint at the
beautiful little village of Giverny. They
experiment with light in all its possible
manifestations. Frieseke and Parker
have an open-air studio together, a
&ldquo;water-garden&rdquo; traversed by a little
brook. Here on warm days they paint
beautiful opalescent nudes in the sunlight,
among the shimmering greens of
the leaves or beside the luminous water
surfaces. All who have followed the
exhibitions in France or even in America
during the last few years are familiar
with this &ldquo;nymph pasture,&rdquo; as it has
been wittily called. It was here that the
prize picture was painted&mdash;but not on
warm, sunny days. A year ago it rained
all summer, and in desperation Mr. Parker
resorted to an indoor canvas, executed in
the house adjoining. It was painted with
extreme care. One comparatively unimportant
part of the canvas, a bit of wall
space, he painted over twelve or fifteen
times to get just the precise shade he
wanted. This painting is now on exhibition
in this country.
</p>

<p>
Lawton Parker&rsquo;s canvases in his Giverny
style are interesting technically. On
a foundation of very careful drawing
they are handled with great freedom of
execution. The brush work is loose and
vigorous, the paint being laid on thickly,
especially in the background. The flesh
is painted more closely, always with
great subtlety in the values. A nude
body in the shade flecked with spots of
brilliant sunlight is a favorite and very
difficult subject, in which this subtlety is
well shown. The color is excellent, at
times, as in the prize picture, very delicate
and carefully harmonized; at times
dealing successfully with great splashes
of autumn leaves or the vivid green of
spring foliage. The composition is
pleasing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parker is not by any means limited
to this style. Indeed, it is in another
and quite different character that he is
best known in this country. As a portrait
painter his work has for a number
of years been gaining steadily in popularity.
Many prominent people have sat
for him, including President Harry
Pratt Judson, Judge Peter S. Grosscup,
Martin Ryerson, Mrs. Leonard Wood,
and Mrs. N. W. Harris.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
This portrait style of Mr. Parker&rsquo;s is
very different from his Giverny style.
He developed it much earlier in his
career, but still uses it on occasion. The
difference is one of psychological viewpoint
rather than of technic. A portrait,
he feels, should be a livable presentation
of the subject. It is not a picture
to be looked at casually and passed
by, but a work to be lived with intimately
for long spaces of time. The exceptions
are, of course, those portraits of
well-known men and women which are
to hang in public places. Generally
speaking, he paints his portraits in color
schemes that will wear well, in a rather
low key, with neutral backgrounds. These
likenesses are solid, dignified, and simple.
To catch the individuality of the sitter
is of more importance to him than to
paint a striking canvas. That his portraits
are successful technically is proved
by the fact that he has taken a number

Lawton Parker was born at Fairfield,
Michigan, in 1868, but spent his early
youth in Kearney, Nebraska. When he
took up seriously the study of painting
he moved to Chicago, which has since
remained his <em>pied-à-terre</em> in this country.
He studied and taught at the Art Institute
there. Later he went to New York,
where, in 1897, he took the &ldquo;Paris
Prize&rdquo; founded by John Armstrong
Chaloner: a five years&rsquo; scholarship
abroad. In Paris he studied under Gerome,
Whistler, and Jean Paul Laurens.
In 1899 he took the &ldquo;<em>Prix d&rsquo;atelier</em>&rdquo; at
the Beaux Arts. In 1900 he received
honorable mention at the Old Salon with
a nude; in 1902 a third medal, on a portrait.
Four years ago he missed by three
votes a second medal, which was fortunate
for him, since the first cannot be
awarded a painter who has received a
second.
</p>

<p>
He has also received medals from the
Chicago Society of Artists, the St. Louis
Exposition, and the International Exhibition
in Munich in 1905.
</p>

<p>
All lovers of art in this country, as
well as the painters themselves, should
thank Mr. Parker for having opened the
way in Paris for so unprecedented an
honor.

<span class="firstchar">P</span><span class="postfirstchar">avlowa</span> and her Russian dancers
have just finished their tour here in
a high tide of enthusiasm,&mdash;and financial
success, which is worth mentioning
because it means other tours next year.
There is a whisper that we shall see a
ballet still more important which hasn&rsquo;t
hitherto been coaxed west of London and
Paris. Only a little of the new art-form
now being developed by Fokine, Diaghilev,
Bakst, Rimski-Korsakoff, and the
rest of the great Russian romanticists of
the stage, has come to us. But the important
fact is that America, as always
behind Europe in seeing new ideas that
are not mechanical, is at last waking up
to the dance as an art on equal terms
with the greatest.
</p>

<p>
It is curious, but not comforting, to
know that in this case the original inspiration
came from Illinois. My authority
is Troy Kinney, who is, without
question, our best-informed critic of
dancing outside of the performers and
choregraphers themselves. Mr. Kinney
tells me that after Isadora Duncan failed
to arouse much interest in America she
went to Europe, leaving a trail of heated
discussion there. When she reached St.
Petersburg the head of the imperial
academy, Fokine, saw the vision of a
renaissance of the dance from its classic
sterility. He gathered about him the
group of dancers whose names are now
known around the world, and persuaded
them to desert the imperial academy,
which clung to the formalism of the old
French and Italian ballet. Artists and
musicians were attracted to the movement.
This proceeding was quite as daring
as it would have been for the superintendent
of the United States Naval
Academy to desert with part of his faculty
and the best of the middies. But
Diaghilev espoused their cause and persuaded
the government not to punish
them, but to let them work out their
ideas and then make themselves useful
politically by showing western Europe
that Russia was not as barbarous as was
generally supposed. They are now fully
recognized in St. Petersburg and Fokine
is again head of the academy.
</p>

<p>
On the basis of the old formal steps
and positions Fokine built a freer structure
of movement whose chief aim is not
virtuosity or pure beauty of line, but
expression. In this new style more modern
music was not only possible, but
necessary. Meanwhile, setting and costume
of the most imaginative type&mdash;often
futuristic&mdash;had to be developed.
They all set to work with an ardor possible
only to tradition-breakers and are
producing an art which is likely to
achieve the supreme place first dreamed
of by the inventors of modern opera.
</p>

<p>
Here is another keenly interesting relation
brought to light by Mr. Kinney.
Everybody knows, of course, that opera
was begun during the Renaissance as an
attempt to revive the Greek drama. It
now appears that in our present Renaissance
the revived ballet is probably much
nearer the highest form of Greek drama
than opera or anything else ever has
been. The early drama of Athens, according
to Mme. Nelidoff of Moscow,
consisted largely of pantomime, dance,
and chorus. Words were introduced for
the literal-minded. As the size of theatres
increased, the actors came to use
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
megaphones, to conceal which the mask
was invented. The masks were made
larger and heavier to add to the height.
With this handicap to dancing, the actor
had to depend more on his voice and stature;
and the elaborate dialogue, combined
with the high heels of the cothurnus,
gave dancing its final blow. This
kind of drama, says Mme. Nelidoff, appealed
largely to the less imaginative
and uncultivated, on account of their
desire to know in detail what was going
on. The other kind, however, continued
being developed for smaller audiences,
and retained its purer beauty of form
in space, sound, and thought. We have
little record of it outside of sculpture
simply because there were few words, and
a choregraphic vocabulary had not been
invented. We have almost no record
of Greek music, either. It is a bit shocking
to think that Aeschylus and Sophocles
were, perhaps, contributors to an
inferior art, but there seem to be
grounds for the ingenious theory.
</p>

<p>
Everyone who has been to a &ldquo;movie
show&rdquo; knows how effective even crude
pantomime can be. But make your pantomime
a portrayal of moods and emotions
rather than of events, give it visual
beauty which will occasionally wring
tears from anyone sensitive to line, and
accompany it with music whose most
complex rhythm and harmonic color are
intensified by the stage picture, and you
have an expression on a plane of the
imagination where the introduction of a
spoken word is like the creak of a piano
pedal. If we can&rsquo;t lead the people back
from the movies to &ldquo;plays,&rdquo; can&rsquo;t we
give them the modern ballet?
</p>

<p>
That is exactly what Kinney proposes.
He wants a National Academy for
America, with resources equal to the
backing of the Metropolitan Opera
House. Big managers and opera authorities
have already admitted that such
an undertaking would, if properly managed,
be successful. Compared with the
present interest in good ballet the interest
in good music with which Theodore
Thomas started, was nothing. But it is
a miracle if America does a thing like
that in the right way. Our princes have,
as a rule, neither good taste nor much
public spirit. Our race of artists&mdash;thinkers&mdash;mental
heroes&mdash;is small and
largely uncourageous. Our government
accurately represents the most of our
people, who still regard art either as
immoral or entertaining and hence not
worth the attention of sensible people.
</p>

<p>
How bitterly we need missionaries like
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> and the people who
feel the same spirit! But our case is
far from hopeless. The good fighters
among us are glad there is a lot still
to do. Such visions give strength to our
hewing arms as we cry room for our
new images.

asserts the remarkable J. D. R., Jr.,
&ldquo;but we will not recognize their organization&rdquo;&mdash;and
here is the hitch. The
average lay observer of the fearful
struggle raging in Colorado tosses aside
his paper after reading this, and possibly
comments that he can&rsquo;t see what
the miners want, if all the union privileges
have been granted.
</p>

<p>
That was my first thought, but I felt
that there must be something behind the
trouble; so I hunted out my old friend
Tony Exposito, a walking delegate for
Chicago&rsquo;s pick-and-shovel men, and asked
him to explain.
</p>

<p>
Now Tony never took a degree, and
his English is reminiscent of sunny Italy,
but he knows just what the trouble is in
Colorado.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh? You wanta know what ees

</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Tony,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I never
thought of it that way. It does seem
as though a man might have what he
earns without its being handed to him
as if it were a charity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure! Sure!&rdquo; cut in the impetuous
Tony. &ldquo;Sure! das da theng&mdash;<em>charety</em>!

</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, Tony,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;they
say that only a few of the men want the
union recognized. What about that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure! Das true! Sure! Das jus

</p>

<p>
And I wondered how many of my
highly educated friends realized so well
as Tony Exposito how frightfully devitalizing
gratuities are, and what it means
to be able to take a week&rsquo;s pay with the
feeling not of accepting a charity, but
of receiving an honest wage for honest
work; what it means to teach mentally
stunned and browbeaten laborers that
they have certain definite rights of life
and happiness, and that they must earn
them; that when they have earned those
rights, it is no <em>favor</em> given or received.

Mr. Chesterton&rsquo;s Prejudices
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>The Flying Inn</em>, by G. K. Chesterton.
[John Lane Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">G</span><span class="postfirstchar">.</span> K. Chesterton really possesses a
philosophy, but it is a question whether
he has ever shown a clear intellectual
title to it. His method of asserting
ownership is to abuse those who question
either his right to possess it or the
desirability of the philosophy itself.
</p>

<p>
In <em>The Flying Inn</em> Mr. Chesterton
does two things. He writes a most
amusing criticism of modern tendencies
the while he is defending his philosophy
of Augustinian Christianity.
</p>

<p>
It may be news to some of Mr.
Chesterton&rsquo;s readers that he is a symbolist
with a profound philosophy to
expound, and I would never have guessed
from his latest work that he was fighting
over again the battle of St. Augustine
against the Pelagians. But this book
recently fell into the hands of a more
than usually industrious and erudite
critic, Mr. Israel Solon, and in a recent
issue of <em>The Friday Literary Review</em> of
<em>The Chicago Evening Post</em>, Mr. Solon
took the trouble to explain some of Mr.
Chesterton&rsquo;s symbolism. The general
reader, however,&mdash;and what a good
thing it is&mdash;does not care a red cent
about the triumph of Augustinian
Christianity, while the unbiased student
of religion knows that Pelagianism, a
healthy-minded British heresy of about
400 <span class="smallcaps">A. D.</span>, which denied original sin, was
a more reasonable proposition than the
Christianity which it tried to displace.
</p>

<p>
The only real interest of Mr. Chesterton&rsquo;s
latest book, then, is in his criticisms
of life, and that interest arises from
their humor rather than from their
worth.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chesterton&rsquo;s theory of criticism
is very simple. Poke fun at everything
you do not like. If it is difficult to poke
fun at it on account of its worth or
dignity then misrepresent it first.
</p>

<p>
The present story, for instance, covers
the adventures of an Irishman who left
the British navy and became a soldier of
fortune, and an innkeeper whose inn is
closed by a fanatical temperance advocate
holding office under a very fussy
pseudo-liberal government. This personage,
who is an amateur of religions and
wishes to combine Mahomedanism and
Christianity, drives the innkeeper into
vagabondage. The Irishman accompanies
him, and they carry the old inn
sign and a keg of rum and a round
cheese with them. They buy a donkey
and cart, and travel the neighborhood
breaking up meetings in favor of temperance,
vegetarianism, polygamy, and
other absurdities advocated by the teetotal
aristocrat.
</p>

<p>
Most of the fooling is excellent, but
some of it is very childish. It shows
Mr. Chesterton at his most characteristic.
He dislikes all liberalism, so the efforts
of the present British government
toward various forms of amelioration of
bonds&mdash;ecclesiastical, puritanic, and economic&mdash;are
satirized by the implication
that the aristocrats of this story
wish to re-establish the Eastern vices of
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
polygamy and abstinence from wine.
He dislikes the Ethical Societies, so he
represents them as meeting in little tin
halls and listening to fakers from the
East preaching strange exotic doctrines
in return for large fees. He dislikes the
Jews, and so a particularly mean and
futile character is painted very carefully
as a Jew who mixes in British politics&mdash;a
thing which Mr. Chesterton and his
political allies seem to think should be
forbidden by statute.
</p>

<p>
If we discount all this, however, we
shall be able to derive a lot of enjoyment
from Mr. Chesterton. In particular
we shall enjoy his songs against
temperance. One of them concerns
Noah&rsquo;s views on drinking:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Old Noah, he had an ostrich farm, and fowls on the greatest scale;</p>

      <p class="verse">But they all were small to the cellar he took when he set out to sail;</p>
      <p class="verse">And Noah, he often said to his wife when he sat down to dine,</p>
      <p class="verse">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care where the water goes if it doesn&rsquo;t <a id="corr-7"></a>get into the wine.&rdquo;</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">The cataract of the cliff of heaven fell blinding off the brink,</p>
      <p class="verse">As if it would wash the stars away as suds go down a sink;</p>
      <p class="verse">The seven heavens came roaring down for the throats of hell to drink,</p>
      <p class="verse">And Noah, he cocked his eye and said: &ldquo;It looks like rain, I think.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="verse">The water has drowned the Matterhorn as deep as a Mendip mine,</p>
      <p class="verse">But I don&rsquo;t care where the water goes if it doesn&rsquo;t get into the wine.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

And for other drinks than those of
orthodox alcoholic content he has nothing
but contempt. Witness the following
remarks:

To the American cocoa debauchee&mdash;if
there be any&mdash;it should be intimated
that in all probability Mr. Chesterton&rsquo;s
turn for symbolism is at work in the
second of the stanzas quoted above.
The English cocoa interests are very
powerful and very much interested in
the progress of the present liberal
government. In England not cocoa
drinkers but certain liberal politicians
will wince with pained appreciation of
that particular stanza.
</p>

<p>
Such is the method of attack with
which Mr. Chesterton goes after liberal
Christianity, the Ethical Movement,
temperance legislation, futurist art, and&mdash;for
some insane reason&mdash;the Mechnikoff
lactic acid bacillus treatment. As
we have said, it is, except in spots, most
interesting and most amusing, but,
except in spots, it is not significant.

Dr. Flexner on Prostitution
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Prostitution in Europe</em>, by Abraham Flexner.
[The Century Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> can be no doubt whatever in the
mind of any student of the evolution of
&ldquo;civic conscience&rdquo; that the prominence
now being given to the subject of prostitution
is one of the most promising
signs of our day. It is inevitable in the
first uncovering of what has been hidden
for many generations that this prominence
should be marred by much that is
to be regretted, by much wild hysteria,
and much morbid dwelling on erstwhile
forbidden topics. But in the main the
knowledge by the people at large of the
cess-pools that lie below our civilization
is the only starting-point from which to
set about the draining and cleaning up
of these cess-pools.
</p>

<p>
As Dr. Flexner points out repeatedly
in this volume, it is public opinion,
and in the last analysis, that only, which
determines the fate of prostitution in
any given city. Even the most stringent
laws are of comparatively little
service when unsupported by an intelligent
and watchful interest on the part
of the people at large. And on what
can an intelligent interest be founded
except on knowledge? The voices raised
in protest&mdash;the voice of Agnes Repplier,
for instance&mdash;belong surely to the protected
&ldquo;leisure class&rdquo;&mdash;the class which
sees no need for change since they have
never known from personal experience
that such problems exist. Yet it is safe
to say that for the great majority of the
world&rsquo;s population the question of prostitution
and its attendent train of disease,
misery, and degeneration is and has
always been one of the most vital questions
of life.
</p>

<p>
A single calm, wise, scientific book, like
this of Dr. Flexner&rsquo;s, given into the
hands of our boys and girls of eighteen,
would do quite as much good, and for
many dispositions infinitely more, than a
whole battery of moral lectures, warning
vaguely against the &ldquo;wickedness of
human nature&rdquo; and the &ldquo;allurements of
sin.&rdquo; Not that this book was written for
boys and girls. Far from it. It was
written for the serious student of the
social evil by Dr. Flexner as representative
of the Bureau of Social Hygiene of
New York City. It is an unprejudiced,
authoritative statement of the present
condition of prostitution in the various
countries of Europe, and is the result
of an impartial and painstaking personal
investigation which required two years
of the time of an educational expert.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Flexner nowhere raises any question
as to how far European experience
is significant for America, but it is inevitable
that the reader should form certain
conclusions of his own. Much of
the book is devoted to the relative merits
of the two systems of handling prostitution
now prevalent in Europe: regulation
and so-called &ldquo;abolition.&rdquo; The
weight of evidence is overwhelmingly on
the side of abolition. Regulation is left
without a leg to stand on. This, however,
is not a burning issue in America.
The New York Committee of Fifteen decided,
years ago, that &ldquo;regulation does
not regulate,&rdquo; and such has been the general
opinion in the United States. But
the remainder of the book and much
that is brought out in the discussion of
regulation can be of great service.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
It is impossible to summarize here a
book so rich both in thought and material.
But one thing may be said for the
encouragement of future readers: There
is in this volume absolutely no trace of
the hysteria so prevalent today, and on
the other hand, no trace of the morbid
dwelling on details from which even some
of our official investigations have unfortunately
not been free. There is in the
entire book not a detailed account of an
individual case to turn the stomach. Yet
the opinion of every prominent expert in
Europe is given, and a calm, scientific
attitude is maintained throughout. We
are, as Jane Addams has so aptly expressed
it, &ldquo;facing an ancient evil with
a new conscience,&rdquo; and this book of Dr.
Flexner&rsquo;s is the embodied voice of that
conscience. This is his last word on the
subject:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
In so far as prostitution is the outcome of
ignorance, laws and police are powerless; only
knowledge will aid. In so far as prostitution
is the outcome of mental or moral defect, laws
and police are powerless; only the intelligent
guardianship of the state will avail. In so
far as prostitution is the outcome of natural
impulses denied a legitimate expression, only
a rationalized social life will really forestall
it. In so far as prostitution is due to alcohol,
to illegitimacy, to broken homes, to bad homes,
to low wages, to wretched industrial conditions&mdash;to
any or all of the particular phenomena
respecting which the modern conscience is
becoming sensitive,&mdash;only a transformation
wrought by education, religion, science, sanitation,
enlightened and far-reaching statesmanship
can effect a cure. Our attitude towards
prostitution, in so far as these factors are concerned,
cannot embody itself in a special remedial
or repressive policy, for in this sense it
must be dealt with as a part of the larger social
problems with which it is inextricably entangled.
Civilization has stripped for a life-and-death
wrestle with tuberculosis, alcohol and other
plagues. It is on the verge of a similar struggle
with the crasser forms of commercialized vice.
Sooner or later it must fling down the gauntlet
to the whole horrible thing. This will be the
real contest,&mdash;a contest that will tax the courage,
the self-denial, the faith, the resources of
humanity to their uttermost.

man. The psychology of it is man-psychology
(unconscious of course), and
its appeal is more strongly to masculine
than to feminine taste&mdash;much as I hate
to think they differ in literature. I have
heard several men speak of it as one of
the best stories they ever read, and I,
myself, though liking it, could never
become more than mildly enthusiastic.
To be sure, it is a great tale of adventure.
But for whom is the great adventure?
Alan and Gerry go blithely about
the world in pursuit of it. Alix, Gerry&rsquo;s
wife, after taking a feeble little step in
the direction of what was for her a stirring
adventure, returns home, chastened,
and is properly punished by years of
waiting for her husband to close up his
small affairs. Her great adventure was
sitting at home rearing Gerry&rsquo;s child.
Clem&rsquo;s seems to have been sitting at
home waiting for Alan to get through
roving and come back to her. And never
a comment to the effect that this should
not have been perfectly soul-satisfying
to both of the women, and never a
notion, apparently, but that they were
richly rewarded for their waiting by
being allowed to spend the rest of their
lives caring for the two bold adventurers.
I couldn&rsquo;t believe a woman living in the
twentieth century could even have imagined
such stupidities. I don&rsquo;t mean that
<em>Home</em> isn&rsquo;t interesting, as stories go, but
it is the crudest kind of man-psychology
and will be as out-of-date in a few years
as <em>Clarissa Harlowe</em> is now.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve been wondering a great deal
lately whether there is a masculine and
feminine literature after one is grown
up. I know there was for me as a
child. When a story like <em>Camp Mates</em>
began in <em>Harper&rsquo;s Young People</em> I
regretted that it was not something by
Lucy C. Lillie, who wrote of adorably
nice little girls. But possibly if I had
ever gone out for long walks and camped
for the day in the open as my own little
lad does now, I too would have read
<em>Camp Mates</em>. A man not undistantly
related to me by marriage confessed the
other day that he was fondest of stories
telling of castaways on desert islands.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thing I&rsquo;d like to do myself&mdash;have
a try at an island,&rdquo; he said, eagerly.
&ldquo;With your wife?&rdquo; I asked, tentatively.
He nodded, and gulped his dinner, and
then immediately repented: &ldquo;With no
woman,&rdquo; he said, firmly; &ldquo;they bring
civilization, and I&rsquo;d want it wild.&rdquo; Well,
I don&rsquo;t blame him. It&rsquo;s appalling to
think of how many men would measure
up to a desert island test&mdash;would procure
by hook or crook some manner of
sustenance. And I can think of few,
very few women (among whom I do not
include myself) whom I should select as
companions if I were thus stranded. I
mean, of course, as far as their resourcefulness
is concerned. Perhaps that is
why, in stories of adventure, the woman
is left behind, inevitably; or, if she is
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
washed up on the shore by the waves,
proves an encumbrance, delightful or
otherwise. And it is all a matter of
training&mdash;not, as our novelist would
have us believe, a deplorable lack of
brains and stamina.
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="THE_EDUCATION_OF_GIRLS">
<span class="smallcaps">The Education of Girls</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
And speaking of training&mdash;an interesting
thing in March <em>Atlantic</em> about
<em>The Education of the Girl</em> has set me
thinking. How am I going to bring up
my daughter? The education of a boy
is, compared to that, a simple matter.
Too ridiculous, too, the answers to my
query returned to me by different friends
and relatives. &ldquo;Make her a good girl,&rdquo;
says one. But surely &ldquo;Be good, fair
maid; let those who will be clever,&rdquo; has
been ridiculed to a timely demise. Another
said: &ldquo;I hope I shall be able to
bring up my daughter so that when she
is grown she can persuade some nice man
to take care of her, as her mother did.&rdquo;
No mention is made, of course, of what
happens if the plan miscarries. It sometimes
does. And it is too funny when
one realizes that several decades ago,
when absolutely no question was raised
as to woman&rsquo;s sphere (home and the
rearing of children), she received in
college a severely classical or scientific
training; and now, when it is by no
means admitted without argument that
home is her one vocation, noted educators
are recommending that women&rsquo;s
colleges abolish Greek and Latin or treat
them and science as purely secondary
and take up domestic science, economics,
nursing, etc., in their place. How can
I tell beforehand which of the two my
daughter is going to need? I think of
myself, filled to the brim with Greek,
Latin, French, and German, producing
in my early married life a distinctly
leathery and most unpleasant pie, or
rushing to the doctor with my baby to
have him treat a dreadful sore which
turned out to be a mosquito bite, and
my tearful struggles with the sewing
machine on my first shirtwaist which I
christened a &ldquo;Dance on the Lawn,&rdquo; for
obvious reasons ... and I wonder.
Never would I willingly give up my
classics and the joy they gave me. But
a <em>soupçon</em> of domesticity would surely
have done me no harm. Miss Harkness,
in this article, is inclined to think that
it does us all harm. She says:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Would men ever get anywhere, do you think,
if they fussed around with as many disconnected
things as most women do? And the
worst of our case is that we are rather inclined
to point with pride to what is really one of the
most vicious habits of our sex.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
But in the meantime that daughter of
mine! Suppose she prefers to run a
house and be the mother of six children!
Some women do, and are wonderfully
fitted for it. Won&rsquo;t she be happier if
she knows beforehand how to do it most
efficiently? I hope, of course, she will
choose, besides, a career of her own; but
if she doesn&rsquo;t want to? And to give
both does mean a scattering of potentialities!
Which brings me back to
the statement that the education of the
modern girl is a complex&mdash;oh, but a
very complex problem.
</p>

<p>
You remember Stevenson&rsquo;s poem to
his wife. I speak of it in this connection
because it throws light on one facet of
the feminist problem which perhaps is
not sufficiently illuminated. He says:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Trusty, dusky, vivid, true,</p>
      <p class="verse">With eyes of gold and bramble-dew;</p>
      <p class="verse">Steel-true and blade straight,</p>
      <p class="verse">The great artificer made my mate.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;Steel-true&rdquo; and &ldquo;blade straight&rdquo;
are epithets more often applied to men;
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
and indeed Mr. McClure, in speaking
of Mrs. Stevenson in his memoirs, says:
&ldquo;She had many of the fine qualities that
are usually attributed to men rather
than women: a fair-mindedness, a large
judgment, a robust, inconsequential
philosophy of life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
How then, if in seeking an ideal education
for girls, we should dismiss, or
at least diminish, the importance of a
purely utilitarian aspect and look for
something that will eventually ensure
such qualities?
</p>

<p>
If, as the feminists urge, they are trying
to raise men to a higher plane, why
not apply a little of this passion for
uplift to the education of women into
nobler, higher attitudes? Steel-true, and
blade straight! I like the sound of that.
</p>

<p>
This education of the girl is getting
to be an obsession with me. Everything
I read resolves itself into terms of girl-psychology.
A ridiculous tale, not long
ago, appeared in <em>The Saturday Evening
Post</em>, called <em>Letting George Do It</em>.
George, in charge of the kitchen for a
few weeks or days, immediately revolutionized
everything; shortened and
lightened labor, invented all sorts of
labor-saving devices, etc., etc. Immediately
all men say, derisively: &ldquo;Well,
that&rsquo;s exactly what a man <em>would</em> do.
You boast that women are as good as
men. Why haven&rsquo;t they, years ago,
done all these things for themselves?&rdquo;
It seemed unanswerable. I have heard
housekeepers, bright women, too, speak
with exasperation of the foolish story,
while helplessly admitting its truth. But
I really think I&rsquo;ve stalked the beast to
its lair. Granted it is true, but have
men spent their lives for centuries in a
narrow round of domestic drudgery?
Women have, and with very little intellectual
diversion, besides, their society
limited to other domestic drudges, and
to their own husbands, who don&rsquo;t try to
broaden them unless they are exceptional
men. And if men had lived such lives
would they have blithely introduced these
reforms just because their masculinity
makes them so superior to women that
they would develop, even under adverse
conditions? They wouldn&rsquo;t stay
drudges, they claim. Well, we won&rsquo;t
either, so George is not so smart as he
thinks he is!
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="GERMAN-AMERICANS_AND_AMERICANS">
<span class="smallcaps">German-Americans and Americans</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
I have been greatly interested in an
article in the May <em>Century</em>. It was by
Prof. Edward A. Ross, of the University
of Wisconsin, the title being <em>The
Germans in America</em>. You know why,
of course. My father was born in
Germany, and came over in 1850. About
ten years ago Hugo Münsterberg had
an article in the <em>Atlantic</em> on the same
subject, in which he tried to explain the
antagonism existing between native-born
Germans and Americans. His argument
summed itself up in the statement that
the German considers the American no
gentleman, and the American considers
the German no gentleman. But <em>why</em>?
I was willing enough to believe him because
of a curious experience of my
childhood. I can remember the incident
perfectly, though it is many years since
it happened. I was in the fifth grade,
and the girl who figured prominently
therein&mdash;her name was <em>Siddons</em>, by the
way, and most appropriately, for she
spelled tragedy to me&mdash;had called out
on the street to a little boy who was
carrying my books home for me, &ldquo;Aw,
George, do you like the Dutch? George
is going with a Dutchman!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
George was certainly no cavalier, for
he dropped my books, mumbled something,
and was off, while I continued
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
on my dazed, bewildered way, wondering
what it was all about. Children
learn so quickly to keep their
deepest hurts to themselves that I doubt
whether I should ever have mentioned
it at home had it not been for this same
bewilderment. My mother was indignant,
not, it seems, because I had had names
flung at me in scorn, but because it was
the wrong name! &ldquo;You are not Dutch.
You are German, and proud of it,&rdquo; she
said, holding her head a little higher.
Pressed for an explanation, she revealed
that my father had been born in
Germany, &ldquo;but you must never, never
be ashamed of that,&rdquo; she added earnestly.
&ldquo;Your father was an educated, cultured
gentleman.&rdquo; I was then taken into our
little library with its crowded shelves
climbing to the ceiling, and shown
volumes of Schiller, Goethe, Lessing in
German, Tauchnitz editions of the great
English writers, books of philosophy
and history, and shelves full of Hayden,
Beethoven, and Mozart. &ldquo;He was a
graduate of a German university,&rdquo; said
mother, &ldquo;and you must pay no attention
to these foolish children whose
parents never even saw an American
university.&rdquo; All very well, but had my
mother been German herself? No, indeed,
so she could hardly realize what
it meant to be an alien and an outcast.
Many times during that hard year, while
the detested Siddons crossed my unwilling
path would I have bartered an educated
and cultured German forbear for
any kind of American, be his lowly occupation
what it might. Later that year
a little French girl, Dunois by name,
came into our grade. Joy! Here was
another alien who would be a companion
in misery. But to my great
surprise she was courted and flattered
by this same Siddons and the two became
bosom friends. The Dunois père kept
a small, unsavory restaurant in a side
street, but the glamour of his &ldquo;Frenchness&rdquo;
was an aureole compared to the
stigma of my &ldquo;Dutchness.&rdquo; That is
still something of a mystery to me, but
the article in the <em>Century</em> explains in
part the cause of this attitude among
unthinking Americans. Prof. Ross says:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Between 1839 and 1845 numerous
old Lutherans, resenting the attempt of
their king to unite Lutheran and Reformed
faiths, migrated hither.... The
political reaction in the German states
after the revolution of 1830, and again
after the revolution of 1848, brought
tens of thousands of liberty-lovers.&rdquo;
And again he says of these political
exiles that they &ldquo;included many men of
unusual attainments and character....
These university professors, physicians,
journalists, and even aristocrats aroused
many of their fellow-countrymen to feel
a pride in German culture, and they left
a stamp of political idealism, social
radicalism and religious skepticism which
is slow to be effaced.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Possibly one reason for American
antagonism to these earlier, superior
settlers was the fact that they did somewhat
despise American culture and hold
rather closely to their own German ways
of thinking. I remember in my childhood,
in my own home, that although
we had <em>Harper&rsquo;s Young People</em> and <em>St.
Nicholas</em>, we also had English <em>Chatterbox</em>&mdash;I
rather fancy as a corrective to
Americanisms to be found in the other
magazines. You know Germans in their
own land today do not wish for American
governesses to teach their children
English; it must be Englishwomen. All
our toys were sent for from the beloved
Fatherland, and beautiful toys they
were, too. We had a system of Froebel
with all his methods established in our
own home, long before the middle western
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
cities dreamed of a public kindergarten.
This deep distrust of American
methods and culture could not help but
impress Americans unfavorably; they
would retaliate with the cry of Dutchman,
perhaps. Prof. Ross goes on to
say:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Germans brought a language, literature,
and social customs of their own,
so that although when scattered they
Americanized with great rapidity wherever
they were strong enough to maintain
church and schools in their own
tongue they were slow to take the American
stamp.&rdquo; So much for those earlier
immigrants. The case is vastly different
with the later tides of immigration.
&ldquo;After 1870,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;the Teutonic
overflow was prompted by economic
motives, and such a migration shows little
persistence in flying the flag of its national
culture. Numbers came, little
instructed.&rdquo; In the words of a German-American,
Knortz, &ldquo;nine-tenths of all
German immigrants come from humble
circumstances and have had only an
indifferent schooling. Whoever, therefore,
expects pride in their German
descent from these people who owe everything
to their new country and nothing
to their fatherland, simply expects too
much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Well, then! If they no longer pride
themselves on being German, and are
easily assimilated by the second generation,
we should expect to see the slight
stigma of being of German descent
removed by this time. But is it? Not
long ago I had occasion to attend a
Bach revival and the beautiful passion
music was played and sung. One of my
friends remarked, &ldquo;You have to get used
to this music before you can appreciate
it,&rdquo; and I retorted condescendingly, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t; I have heard it from childhood.
This is the kind of music we sing in the
Lutheran church.&rdquo; This same friend
later, guiding my tottering steps
through the mazes and pitfalls of society
in the &ldquo;most aristocratic suburb of New
York,&rdquo; said hesitatingly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;d mention it, especially to people in
general, that I was a Lutheran, if I were
you.&rdquo; Of course I was seized immediately
with a perfectly natural desire
to talk of it in season and out to everyone
I met. Why not? Why not be a
Lutheran as naturally as an Episcopalian
or a Methodist? &ldquo;Well, they are
mostly Germans, you see.&rdquo; But I don&rsquo;t
see, and I never have seen, although this
article, enlightening and interesting, goes
nearer to the reasons for such an attitude
than anything else I have ever read.
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="REJECTIONS_BY_EDITORS">
<span class="smallcaps">Rejections by Editors</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Never again shall I feel a sense of
shame and humiliation on receiving my
rejected MS. <em>and</em> the printed slip. I
have always suspected that it was on
account of the editors&rsquo; lack of taste and
discrimination; now I am sure of it.
Indeed, I&rsquo;m not quite sure but that it
argues more to be rejected than to be
accepted. I&rsquo;m beginning to be <em>proud</em>
of it. Read Henry Sydnor Harrison&rsquo;s
article in the April <em>Atlantic</em>&mdash;<em>Adventures
with the Editors</em>&mdash;and see if you
don&rsquo;t feel the same way! Or, perhaps,
you&rsquo;ve never been rejected with the
added ignominy of the printed slip. If
so, don&rsquo;t read this; it is not for you.
But all ye rejected ones take renewed
hope from this statement that an editor,
actually an editor himself, has made:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I can tell you why editors
so frequently reject the earlier and often
the best work of writers: it is because
any new writer who sends in first-class
work sends in work that is very different
from what editors are used to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
It reminds me of a time when I wrote,
maliciously, I admit, to a certain well-known
magazine, to tell its editors a
story they had printed by a renowned
author had been cribbed entire (unconsciously,
possibly) from an old
classic; and I told them, too, if they
would prefer to print original stories,
I had one on hand. I got back such a
deliciously solemn reply regretting the
unconscious plagiarism and asking me
to send on any story I had. I did not
do so, for the good and sufficient reason
that I had already sent it to them
several weeks previously, and had had it
rejected without comment. No doubt it
deserved to be rejected; every one else
did the same with it. To be sure, one
kindly editor took the pains to tell me
why, personally. &ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t enough story. Your
character-drawing is both careful and
sincere, however.&rdquo; So it must have been
dull to deserve anything like that. I
wish we could hear a little more of the
experiences of those poor rejected, who
never do &ldquo;get over the wall,&rdquo; as Mr.
Harrison terms it. I imagine it would be
both illuminating and ludicrous.
</p>

<p>
And, oh! the happy moments I had on
reading E. S. Martin&rsquo;s comments, in <em>Life</em>,
on Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s article. Mr. Harrison
makes the charge that magazines
will print poor stories of well known
writers in preference to good stories of
the unknown, and Mr. Martin&rsquo;s response
is:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It does not follow that the editors
were wrong because they did not buy
Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s tales before <em>Queed</em>.
Maybe they were not more than average
stories. But after <em>Queed</em> they were
stories by the author of <em>Queed</em>....
<em>Queed</em> pulled all Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s past
tales out of the ruck, and put them in
the running. It was hardly fair to
expect the editors to pick them for
winners beforehand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What then are editors for, if not to
&ldquo;pick winners?&rdquo; And Mr. Harrison
says himself that <em>Queed</em> was rejected by
two publishers. Probably it was hardly
fair to expect the publishers to pick such
a winner in advance. We, the rejected,
have always humbly thought that was
their occupation&mdash;their <em>raison d&rsquo;être</em>.
And if Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s short stories <em>were</em>
&ldquo;not more than average stories,&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t
it prove his contention that average
poor stories by the known are more
acceptable to editors than good ones by
the unknown?
</p>

<p>
At least I am going to think so, and
some day I shall write an article on the
lofty distinction of being rejected.

American progress in autobiographical form,
by the Greek woman who wrote <em>Haremlik</em>.
</p>

<p>
<em>Anybody but Anne</em>, by Carolyn Wells. [J. B.
Lippincott Company, Philadelphia.] A mystery
story of which the most fascinating feature is
the architect&rsquo;s plan of the house in which it
takes place.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Flower-Finder</em>, by George Lincoln Walton;
with frontispiece by W. H. Stedman and
photographs by Henry Troth. [J. B. Lippincott
Company, Philadelphia.] Worth owning
if merely for the end-papers which literally
lead you into a spring woods. A comprehensive
pocket guide to wild flowers.
</p>

<p>
<em>Prisons and Prisoners</em>: Personal Experiences
of Constance Lytton and Jane Warton, Spinster.
[George H. Doran Company, New York.]
As Lady Lytton, an enthusiastic convert to
militant suffrage, the author received courteous
treatment in prison; disguised successfully as

Everyone who doubts the martyrdom or
the intrepidity of the suffragettes ought to
read this record.
</p>

<p>

views of the feminist movement by a literary

</p>

<p>
<em>The Beginning of Grand Opera in Chicago</em>
(1850-1859), by Karleton Hackett. [The Laurentian
Publishers, Chicago.] Mr. Hackett is a
man of ideas and he might have written an interesting
book by taking &ldquo;grand opera in Chicago&rdquo;
as his theme. Instead, he has done a
hack job with its early history and been given
the distinction of tasteful binding and printing.
</p>

by Edward O. Otis, M.D. [Thomas Y.
Crowell Company, New York.] A revised edition
of an old, popular book &ldquo;for laymen.&rdquo;

<em>Richard Wagner: The Man and His Work</em>, by
Oliver Huckel. [Thomas Y. Crowell Company,

of Wagner as &ldquo;the greatest genius
that art has produced&rdquo; and Rupert Brooke&rsquo;s
as an emotionalist with &ldquo;a fat, wide, hairless
face&rdquo; there ought to be a man worth biographies
<em>ad infinitum</em>. Dr. Huckel&rsquo;s is simply
a clear condensation for the general reader of
standard biographical material, and is worth
while.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Book of the Epic: All the World&rsquo;s Great
Epics Told in Story</em>, by H. A. Guerber; with introduction
by J. Berg Esenwein. [J. B. Lippincott
Company, Philadelphia.] The most satisfying
compilation in the field that has ever
been offered to the young student or general
reader.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Practical Book of Garden Architecture</em>,
by Phebe Westcott Humphreys. [J. B. Lippincott
Company, Philadelphia.] A weighty chronicle
of garden architecture, observations in
many lands and under many conditions. &ldquo;A

Letters to The Little Review
</h2>

</div>

<div class="letters">
<p class="attr">
<em>A. S. K., Chicago</em>:
</p>

<p>
With your permission I shall try to explain
why I am not enthusiastic about the second
issue of your magazine:
</p>

<p>
The crime of the April issue lies in the fact
of its closely following (chronologically) the
issue of March. In the beginning you appeared
to us as a prophet, and we wistfully listened to
your unique message; now you have degenerated
into a priest, a dignified station indeed, but
don&rsquo;t you think there are already more priests
than worshippers in our Temple? If you are
going to be &ldquo;one of many&rdquo; I question the
<em>raison d&rsquo;être</em> of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>.
</p>

<p>
Your debut was a revelation, a new word, a
rejuvenating breeze in the tepid atmosphere of
our periodical press. It was a wonderful number,
all fresh and beautiful; even the one or
two grotesque pieces that had smuggled in
drowned in the mass of splendor, just as the
heavy colors of the rainbow soften in the powerful
symphony of the spectrum.
</p>

<p>
Now, frankly, would you sign your name
under every article of the April <span class="smallcaps">Review</span>? I
hope not! You have turned your temple into
a parliament of dissonances; you have admitted
Victorian ladies and sentimental crucifiers of
Nietzsche; you have even polluted your pages
with an anti-Bathhouse tirade! Then that
cacophony of personal letters: I blushed at
the sight of these tokens of familiarity and tappings
over your shoulder on the part of the
benevolent readers. I wished to shout to the
Misses Jones to keep off the altar, lest they
besmirch your white robe with their penny compliments
and saccharine effusions.
</p>

<p>
I could hardly make myself believe that this
irritating copy was <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>.
</p>

<p>
Pardon this frankness. But I wish you success,
not popularity.
</p>

<p class="attr">
<em>Mary W. Ohr, Indianapolis</em>:
</p>

<p>
Let me tell you how much pleasure you have
given me in the second issue of your magazine.
You are certainly to be congratulated upon
having the initiative to start anything so great
as this.
</p>

<p>
I have reserved writing to you until now, for
I wished to avoid the appearance of trying to
tear down or discourage an effort that was so
much bigger than anything I could ever achieve.
Your article on <em>The Dark Flower</em> made me feel
that possibly intolerance might be your stumbling
block, and that your youth and enthusiasm
might lead you into many pitfalls that might
not be for the betterment of your work. But
this number has made me your equal in enthusiasm,
and I believe <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> is here
to stay.
</p>

<p class="attr">
<em>Verne DeWitt Rowell, London, Ontario</em>:
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> is a whirlwind surprise.
There is nothing like it in America. I am glad
to see you playing up Nietzsche. Over here in
this little town we have a Nietzschean vogue,
and we are all delighted. Truly the intellectual
center of America has shifted westward. To be
sure, New York has <em>The International</em>; but Chicago
has <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>, <em>The Trimmed
Lamp</em>, and one or two other magazines of real
literature. Then there is Burns Lee&rsquo;s <em>Bell Cow</em>
in Cleveland. Nietzsche is coming into his own
at last. Wishing every success to <span class="smallcaps">The Little
Review</span>, which is one of the two best magazines
in America (the other is <em>Current Opinion</em>).
</p>

<p class="attr">
<em>Mollie Levin, Chicago</em>:
</p>

<p>
The formal bow that <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>
made to the public in its first issue violated
tradition beautifully by doing what formal bows
never do&mdash;really mean something. It is glorious
to be young and enthusiastic, and still more
so to be courageous; and whatever goes into
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> in that spirit is admirable,
regardless of any reader&rsquo;s personal judgment.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s good, too, to have used <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>:
It makes me think of a child&mdash;beautiful
in its present stage and with promise of
infinite fulfillment.
</p>

<p class="attr">
<em>Marie Patridge, Clearfield, Pa.</em>:
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve been tremendously interested in the second
issue. It seems to me your critic is wrong
in speaking of juvenility or the restrictive tone
of the magazine. It&rsquo;s exactly that which gives
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> an excuse for being, that
it is not like all other magazines with their cut-and-dried
precision and their &ldquo;Thus saith the
Lord&rdquo; attitude toward things.
</p>

<p>
As time goes on I think it will be wise to
enlarge the scope&mdash;more of drama, more of
<a id="page-53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a>
music, more of world politics and science. You
will thus get away from the aesthetic tendency
which your critic mentions.
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed the Wells discussion so much. And
yet Miss Trevor doesn&rsquo;t advance any real arguments.
It&rsquo;s very easy to call people muddle-headed
and vaguely sentimental, but an appeal
to the upbuilding of character isn&rsquo;t slushy.
I&rsquo;m inclined to agree with &ldquo;M. M.,&rdquo; though
I&rsquo;d like to hear an advanced&mdash;not a hysterical&mdash;argument
on the subject. I&rsquo;m willing to be
convinced of the other side, but assuredly it
would take something stronger and sterner and
more logical than Miss Trevor.
</p>

<p class="note">
[The suggestion about enlarging our scope is
one we hoped no one would make until we had
done it, that being the plan closest to our hearts.
We can only explain our shortcomings in this
regard by referring to a homely but reasonable
saying about not being able to do everything at
once.&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">The Editor.</span>]
</p>

<p class="attr">
<em>Mabel Frush, Chicago</em>:
</p>

<p>
You have invited frank criticism, and that
is my reason for not writing at first: I could
not accept it all. In the first place, regarding
Paderewski. Do you never find him a bit over-powering;
do you never feel that a trifle more
restraint might give greater strength? In Grieg,
for instance, does he carry you up into the
high places, give you that impression of unlimited
space, rugged strength, and wild beauty?
Is he not too subjective?
</p>

<p>
I quite agree with you as regards Chopin and
Schumann. There he is satisfying. His interpretations
carry a quality that other artists
sometimes treat too lightly; forgetting &ldquo;a
man&rsquo;s reach must exceed his grasp,&rdquo; and so
sacrificing the greater to the lesser in striving
for perfection. Impotency is the price of ultra-civilization.
</p>

<p>
Your comments on temperament are interesting,
but I feel you are not quite fair in your
comparisons. Is not Paderewski&rsquo;s genius largely
a racial gift? To me all Russian (or Polish)
art&mdash;both creative and interpretative&mdash;possesses
the flame of the elemental, that generative
quality which marks the difference between
technical perfection and living, breathing, throbbing
art. Appreciating that &ldquo;all music is what
awakens in you when reminded by the instrument,&rdquo;
he strives for but one thing: an emotional
releasement that results in a temperamental
orgy which leaves his hearers dazed, lost
in the labyrinth of their own emotions.
</p>

<p>
As for Rupert Brooke&rsquo;s poetry, I regard him
as decadent&mdash;at least too much so to be really
vital. Perhaps my vision is clouded, but I could
as easily conceive of Johnson worshipping at
the shrine of Boswell as of Whitman liking
Brooke. Now and then he impresses me as
being effete, and I can never separate him from
a cult, though I do delight in some of his
poems.
</p>

<p class="attr">
<em>Mrs. William H. Andrews, Cleveland</em>:
</p>

<p>
May I put in my little word and wish you all
good speed, editor of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>?
</p>

<p>
You evidently live in the clear blue sky
where fresh enthusiasms rush on like white
clouds bearing us irresistibly along. Life grows
even more vivid under such stimulating courage
and pulsing optimism.
</p>

<p>
The world is indeed wonderful if we but live
it passionately, as did Jean Christophe and
Antoine, leaping forward, breasting the waves,
with music in the soul. My ears are singing
with the third movement of Tschaikowsky&rsquo;s
immortal <em>Pathetique</em>, which to me, in larger
part, so belies its name.
</p>

<p>
Hail to <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>! May it dart
&ldquo;rose-crowned&rdquo; along its shining way, emblazoning
the path for many of us.
</p>

<p class="attr">
<em>Mary Carolyn Davies, New York</em>:
</p>

<p>
I have just finished reading <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>
from cover to cover, and much of it twice
over.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for loving the things I love, and
thank you for being young and not being afraid
to be young! This is such a good day to be
young in!
</p>

<p>
With all good wishes for the success of <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span> (though it needs no good wishes,
for it cannot help succeeding).
</p>

<p class="attr">
<em>P. H. W., Chicago</em>:
</p>

<p>
The article on Mrs. Meynell in your April
issue sounded a little curious in its surroundings,
as it was a piece of pure criticism and
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> is the official organ of
exuberance. It is the only one, in fact, and it
is a good thing to have such an organ.

<p>
The years this volume embraces were three of the most critical
in the life of the French Republic. Their principal events
and conspicuous characters are vividly described by an expert
writer who was within the inmost circles of society and diplomacy&mdash;she
was the daughter of President King of Columbia, and
had just married M. William Waddington, one of the leading
French diplomats and statesmen of the time.

<p>
Harvard, as it was in the days when, first William, and then
Henry, James were undergraduates, is pictured and commented
upon by these two famous brothers&mdash;by William James through
a series of letters written at the time. The book carries forward
the early lives of William and Henry, which was begun in &ldquo;A
Small Boy and Others,&rdquo; published a year ago. Among the distinguished
men pictured in its pages are John LaFarge, Hunt,
Professor Norton, Professor Childs, and Ralph Waldo Emerson,
who was a close friend of Henry James, Senior.

<p>
The writer believes that &ldquo;The Yellow Peril may be transformed
into golden advantage for us, even as the White Peril in the Orient
is bringing unexpected benefits to those lands.&rdquo; The statement of
this idea forms a part of a comprehensive and authoritative discussion
of the entire subject as set forth in the title. The author has
had a lifetime of intimacy with both nations, and is trusted and
consulted by the governments of each.

The Influence of the Bible

<p>
This is an attempt to answer by the historical method the great
question of the day: &ldquo;How can Christianity and civilisation advance
in harmony?&rdquo; The writer simply follows the traces of the Bible
through the different periods of Christian history&mdash;a task which,
singularly enough, has hardly ever before even been attempted, and
never before successfully or even thoroughly done.

An important and extraordinarily interesting study of the relationship

to pointing out the <em>differences</em> between Babylonian myths, beliefs,

<em>12 Volumes</em>
<em>Each with frontispiece</em>
</p>

<p>
A series of art guides, whose
little volumes, unique in conception
and execution, should be as
natural and essential a part of
every man&rsquo;s traveling equipment
as the Baedeker guide-books
are now.
</p>

<p>
They are the only descriptive
and critical art guides in existence.
They are written by the
high authority on art, who is
probably better acquainted than
any other writer living with the
European galleries.
</p>

<p>
They are composed of clear,
pointed critical notes upon individual
pictures, written before
those pictures by the author.
</p>

<p>
These notes deal comprehensively
with practically all of the
European galleries; and therefore
discuss and explain practically
all the important paintings
that hang in those galleries.
</p>

<p>
The volumes are so manufactured
as to be easily carried, and they
combine perfectly the qualities of
beauty and durability.

A New Book of
Permanent Literary
Value
</p>

<p>
The GLEBE publishes
twelve or more complete
books a year. It is an attempt
on the part of the editors and
publishers to issue books entirely
on their own merit and
regardless of their chance for
popular sale. Once a month&mdash;and
occasionally more frequently&mdash;the
GLEBE brings
out the complete work of
one individual arranged in
book form and free from editorials
and other extraneous
matter.
</p>

<p>
Prominent among numbers
for the year 1914 are <em>Des
Imagistes</em>, an anthology of
the Imagists&rsquo; movement in
England, including <em>Pound</em>,
<em>Hueffer</em>, <em>Aldington</em>, <em>Flint</em>
<em>and others</em>; essays by <span class="smallcaps">Ellen
Key</span>; a play by <span class="smallcaps">Frank
Wedekind</span>; collects and
prose pieces by <span class="smallcaps">Horace
Traubel</span>; and <span class="smallcaps">The Doina</span>,
translations by <span class="smallcaps">Maurice
Aisen</span> of Roumanian folksongs.
The main purpose of
the GLEBE is to bring to
light the really fine work of
unknown men. These will
appear throughout the year.

<p>
Inspirational prose pieces fired by revolutionary idealism
and prophetically subtle in their vision. The high
esteem in which Traubel&rsquo;s work is held is attested by the
following unusual commendations:
</p>

<p>
<b>Jack London</b>: &ldquo;His is the vision of the poet and the voice
of the poet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<b>Clarence Darrow</b>: &ldquo;Horace Traubel is both a poet and a
philosopher. No one can say anything too good about him or
his work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<b>George D. Herron</b>: &ldquo;It is a book of the highest value and
beauty that Horace Traubel proposes to give us, and I can
only hope that it will be read as widely and appreciatively
as it more than deserves to be; for it is with a joy that would
seem extravagant, if I expressed it, that I welcome &lsquo;Chants
Communal.&rsquo;&rdquo;

<p>
The author undertakes to show that the agencies which
are used in distributing the products of industry and are
responsible for the extremes in the social scale have never
been adopted by any rational action, but have come to be
through fortuitous circumstances and are without moral
basis. The wage system, as a means of distribution, is
utterly inadequate to measure the workers&rsquo; share. The
source of permanent improvement is found in social ownership,
which transfers the power over distribution from the
hands of those individuals who now own the instruments
of production to the hands of the people.

This pathetic little story was first issued by Mr. Mosher in a privately printed edition
of 500 copies and was practically sold out before January 1, 1913. The late Dr. Weir
Mitchell in a letter to the owner of the copyright said among other things: &ldquo;Certainly
no more beautiful piece of English has been printed of late years.&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;May
I ask if this lady did not leave other literary products? The one you print is so unusual
in style and quality and imagination that after I read it I felt convinced there must be
other matter of like character.&rdquo;

To the lover of what may be called spiritual autobiography, perhaps no other book in
recent English literature appeals with so potent a charm as &ldquo;The Private Papers of
Henry Ryecroft.&rdquo; It is the highest expression of Gissing&rsquo;s genius&mdash;a book that deserves
a place on the same shelf with the Journals of De Guérin and Amiel. For the
present publication, the numerous passages of the &ldquo;Papers&rdquo; relating to books and
reading have been brought together and given an external setting appropriate to their
exquisite literary flavor.
